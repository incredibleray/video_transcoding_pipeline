諸佛菩薩，六祖師傅上人，
各位出家人，各位善知識阿彌陀佛

31
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:38,800
hello everyone today is the 6th of August
2022. thank you all for joining us in this

32
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:47,750
explanation of the sixth patriarch sutra we are
currently in chapter 2 uh slide 180. chapter

33
00:07:47,750 --> 00:08:00,030
2 is teaching us about this wisdom
from enlightenment that is um and this is

34
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:07,509
the kind of wisdom that you have already and
you don't know how to use it okay you lost

35
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:15,710
track of it because of your incessant revolution
in the wheel of reincarnation every time we have

36
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:25,509
a new body we get a little bit further away
from this this great wisdom of ours so that's

37
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:33,719
why it's like it has so many layers that we
can no longer recognize it we can no longer

38
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:43,050
know how to access it so the Buddhism is about
the way for you to recognize what you have

39
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:50,149
recognize the treasure in your mind and know
how to use it okay and so sixth sixth patriarch

40
00:08:50,149 --> 00:09:01,680
is one of the best teachers in Chinese Buddhism
and he's really the foremost teacher on sudden

41
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,930
enlightenment on sudden teaching sudden
teachings is a kind of teaching that will

42
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:16,370
enable you to straight away reach enlightenment
easier said than done but at least the kind

43
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:23,640
of technology is available for everyone to
anyone and so he's been teaching us about

44
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,540
this prajna thing I think this prajna is
sanskrit word for transcendental wisdom the

45
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:36,980
kind of wisdom that will free you from any
kind of hindrances any kind of obstructions

46
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:49,220
against your wishes okay and so so what's
special about his instructions is that he

47
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:58,680
gave us secret recipes on how to reach or
rediscover or reconnect with our prajna

48
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:05,380
wisdom so maybe initially you won't be able
to do it but you should know about it you

49
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:12,910
should hear about it eventually down the road
in time it's going to happen to you this is

50
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:20,970
one of the ancient Buddhist wisdoms ancient
Buddhist secrets that is we all eventually

51
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:30,860
will be able to rekindle to reconnect with
our incredible wisdom okay that's a fact the

52
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:40,800
Buddha all Buddhas guaranteed it it's nothing
new at all so so don't look down upon yourself

53
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,320
don't sell yourself short you are perfectly
capable to be the best you can be and be

54
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:55,760
equal of all Buddhas and it's because of
the blessings you planted in the past and

55
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,630
you continue to plant the more blessings you
plant the quicker you get there that's all

56
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:09,920
so now it's 180 and look at sutra text thank
you all the Buddhas in three periods of time

57
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:17,610
and the 12 divisions of sutra texts as well
exists within the nature of people originally

58
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,980
complete with them within them

59
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:31,220
[reading Chinese sutra text]

60
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:41,370
okay 181 he says that all Buddhas of the three
periods of time three periods of time in Buddhism

61
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:50,520
means of the past and the present of the future
meaning all Buddhists from the past all Buddhas

62
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:56,940
are present right now in the universe and
all Buddhas on future Buddhists in the universe

63
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:04,670
okay so this refers to the fact all Buddhas
at all times and the 12 division of sutra texts

64
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:13,160
as well the 12 divisions of sutra text refers
to all the Buddhist texts that the Buddha when

65
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:21,540
the Buddha came to our world and gave us sermons
or preached his teachings and they can be

66
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:28,440
classified into 12 different types of

67
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:35,300
language I mean phrasing and that's what
they call 12 divisions okay and and it says

68
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:43,810
it exists within the nature of people he says
that you nature of people refers to you to me

69
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:50,870
to all of us all of us are endowed with this
thing called nature or the short nature short

70
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:58,320
for Buddha nature meaning that we have it
believe it or not this nature here is as vast

71
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,300
as the universe it's no different from the
universe it contains everything in that little

72
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:15,000
thing of a frame of yours it has it infinite
uh thing uh that's uh contained within it

73
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,680
you believe it or not you see uh see it's
not something that you can understand and

74
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,000
this is why it's called wisdom you don't have
enough wisdom yet to understand and that's

75
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:42,250
why you need more time to um begin to rediscover
your true self okay so it says that all the

76
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:51,829
Buddhas all the Buddhas in this universe are
they exist within our nature how is it possible

77
00:13:51,829 --> 00:14:02,310
how is it possible

78
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:10,120
how can all Buddhas especially for you intellectual
people rational people how come how can Buddhas

79
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:17,870
who have not come have not come Buddhas yet
they all exist in our nature how can something

80
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:25,820
hasn't come to fruition fruition yet who
has not come to existence yet they also exist

81
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:33,760
in our nature your nature and my nature

82
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:41,750
nature of short people nature of children
nature of tall people nature of yellow people

83
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:51,699
nature of white face people pale face people
all people all living beings they have this

84
00:14:51,699 --> 00:15:01,190
nature that contains all Buddhas of the three
periods of time and all the teachings

85
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:08,139
so that's why for example master XuanHua when
he was lecturing sutras he never used any

86
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:15,360
texts like us okay he doesn't have to read
his slides or look at the sutras and read

87
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,500
from sutras he would sort of like open his
spiritual eye and start like we do here instead

88
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,820
of me reading from the slide here moving the
cursor and the mouse and say all Buddha three

89
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,269
periods of time I have to read it he would
you know sort of close his eyes and they started

90
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:39,630
reading off somewhere in space

91
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:46,800
proof right there that he's able to see it

92
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:56,050
and and uh so that's uh that's uh so he can
see it within his nature okay his Buddha nature

93
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:06,600
so Buddha nature is replete with everything
okay and it is uh accessible through you through

94
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,570
your small frame the little girl's frame is that
okay to mention your name right now honey

95
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:19,819
she said you have to ask my permission next
time

96
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:30,730
you understand permission is that okay okay
there you go thank you okay so so all the

97
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:43,920
the nature the natures refers to the Buddha
nature that each and every single living being

98
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:52,000
possesses okay and it says in that nature
right there are you have everything you have the

99
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,910
entire universe you have Buddhas all teachings
as well so far so good

100
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:06,130
and that's why so the self nature these are
the little bit of a jargon you should remember

101
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:11,179
and that's important because this is yours
it's like this your treasure make sure you

102
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:17,539
recognize it don't throw it away right so
something that we mentioned nature is your

103
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:25,770
Buddha nature your self-nature those are the
jargons it tells that tells you about the

104
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:34,150
true treasure that you all possess we all
possess okay uh it's worth a lot more than

105
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:39,750
a house in San Jose

106
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:48,480
okay and and the all these Buddha in the three
periods of time and and the all the sutra

107
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:57,330
texts uh they exist and originally complete
with them within them it means nothing lacking

108
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:06,400
at all we are we have everything there is
in other words all the treasures are within

109
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:14,370
you when we worldly people when you get education
we get training get experience what we are

110
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:23,080
learned to do we learn to look outside look
at how the external world functions and we're

111
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:29,740
fascinated by that fascinating how to build
bridge how to build things how to acquire

112
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:36,679
things and so forth and so what happened is
is right there is the confirmation to you

113
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:45,620
the proof to you that we so we are so brainwashed
into looking outside that's why we forget

114
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:51,980
about our own treasure

115
00:18:51,980 --> 00:19:02,679
okay and and that's the difference about Buddhism
Buddhism says that the ultimate Buddhist wisdom

116
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:14,100
is that you are just like me and I exist within
you I'm not different from you at all all

117
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:21,280
right 182 if you're unable to enlighten
yourself you should seek out the instruction

118
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,760
of a good knowing advisor who'll instruct and lead
you to see your nature

119
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:40,960
[Read sutra text in Chinese] well Chinese pronunciation is a little
bit sharper than Taiwanese I'm noticing it

120
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:53,809
beautiful okay so he says I know you're skeptical
it sounds too good to be true right Daniel

121
00:19:53,809 --> 00:20:01,400
me is it me my nature has everything how come am
I so poor huh how come I struggle so much

122
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:10,250
okay how come I'm not married yet okay he
says if you're unable to enlighten yourself

123
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:17,580
meaning uh he says he addresses all
these people his disciples have been teaching

124
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:23,400
all these years I've been telling you over
and over again and you still are not there

125
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:29,559
you still cannot see your nature so that's
it's referring to such people that includes

126
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:37,150
us if we are unable to enlighten ourselves we
should seek out the instruction of a good

127
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:44,070
knowing advisor it says if you can't see it
you cannot see the nature you cannot see the

128
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:54,500
sutras in space you cannot see the sutras
inside of your nature okay if you cannot access

129
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:02,910
your own enlightened your own wisdom then
what you ought to do you should seek out the

130
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:08,320
instructions of a good knowing advisor good knowing
advisor again is a technical term another

131
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:15,240
jargon is someone who is enlightened and who
can teach us how to become enlightened he

132
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:21,039
can show us the way okay so that's what he
says good knowing advisers in Buddhism are the

133
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:30,170
ones who have enough wisdom to instruct us
give give us instructions on how to be just

134
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:39,710
like them no less okay remember when you become
enlightened when you see your nature we're all

135
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:48,030
the same you then realize that woman is not
different for men girl is not different from

136
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:55,140
boys okay little girls is the same as adults
okay it's no more discrimination it's no more

137
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:03,650
differentiation no more differences between
you and me between ethnicities between uh

138
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:10,789
height some people are short some people are
tall okay it's my fascination I don't know

139
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:16,640
why the Chinese people who are wiser than
than I am they're all shorter than I am for

140
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,830
some reason I don't get it

141
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:29,570
the the people I admire most have incredible
wisdom that's all so short and skinny

142
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:36,630
okay they must never eat pizza or anything like
that

143
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:50,429
I understand that little girl doesn't eat
tacos I can see you yes you do last night

144
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:53,299
finally

145
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:59,690
before you forgot ah okay how about churros

146
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:09,710
churros? churros is good

147
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:17,200
okay so you should seek out the instructional
good knowing advisor good knowing advisors by the

148
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:27,650
way are the ones who would be gladly share
be we have the opportunity to share with you

149
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:33,390
uh how to enlighten yourself

150
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:38,659
and this this is the thing why because once
you're enlightened you have the wisdom you

151
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:43,390
know that you're the same as others that's
therefore why should you hold back why you

152
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:49,700
should not help others you help others it's
the same as helping you

153
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,029
okay so that's why you should have no fear
you say you want to become enlightened you

154
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:59,659
want to open your wisdom seek out someone
who has done it already and you know what

155
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:07,070
you find out they will gladly share with you
uh

156
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:14,151
and they share the instruction what the instruction
will do for you they will show you instruct

157
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:22,809
you and lead you to see your nature so a teacher
a wise teacher is not the one who makes promises

158
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:29,789
he's not the one who tells you stories you're
not the one who would waste your time it's

159
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:37,940
the one that says um so you want to become
enlightened you want to be the same

160
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:46,980
as all Buddhas to help you want to be
at your best then I will instruct you I will

161
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,530
tell you how to do it not only will I instruct
you the good knowing advisor is supposed to give

162
00:24:52,530 --> 00:25:02,029
you instruction instruction meaning do this
and do that it's not theory folks

163
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:08,120
this is a mistake that you make when you meet
and seeing good knowing advisor you think good

164
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,809
knowing advisors are going to sit there and argue
with you and demonstrate to you that they

165
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:18,510
know more than you and they that you are stupid
you don't understand Buddhism at all so they

166
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:25,419
would keep on talking endlessly about this
suture and all the sutures and the principles

167
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:33,010
and how wonderful their their knowledge is
how deep the knowledge is no good knowing advisers

168
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:39,820
don't do that that's for professors that's
for people who are not enlightened who have

169
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:45,440
a lot of time remember enlightened people
are busy helping others become enlightened

170
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,390
so they don't have time to waste with you
for me with me as a matter of fact as well

171
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:57,390
okay and so they would not spend time telling
you about how much they know about this sutra

172
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:02,910
or the other sutra how much they know about
wine how much you know about you know geography

173
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:07,820
history and so forth what they will tell you

174
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:14,529
is what you need to do what you need to know
in order to become enligtened that's it nothing

175
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:24,250
more it's very specific instructions that
are but that are peculiar to you specific

176
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:29,990
to you only it's not like you know do this
and get rich and so forth anyone can do that

177
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:36,399
he says for you to get rich what you need
to do is buy this cryptocurrency called uh

178
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:41,460
okay and then you hold it for so long and
then you switch to the other cryptocurrency

179
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,960
because this one will crash and so forth so
there's so detailed you know I remember I

180
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,490
don't know you believe it or not

181
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:56,809
when I first started teaching Chan meditation
I met this guy here who's uh really not a

182
00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:03,419
Buddhist believer but uh in a Chinese
Vietnamese guy his teacher specializes in

183
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:13,600
YiJing YiJing is the Chinese wisdom they can
look at the phenomena in nature and they can

184
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,010
tell you what's going to happen in the future
for example someone was so good that they're

185
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,760
a bunch of Vietnamese guys sitting together
gabbing away and drinking Vietnamese coffee

186
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:31,830
anyone Vietnamese coffee okay so they are drinking
coffee and then and the guy says oh okay okay

187
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:38,740
guys I needed I need to take off so the guy
who's specialist in YiJing okay uh

188
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:46,549
you might want to remember this if you find
those people who know YiJing they're incredible

189
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:57,240
the YiJing specialist he just says oh watch out don't
get into an accident and the guy seriously

190
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,679
so he drove up not thinking much about it
and turned the corner and got in an accident

191
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,960
right away

192
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,539
that's YiJing for you and this is real they
can see you know like birds flying through

193
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:16,799
oh it's going to rain tomorrow something like
that okay that's YiJing wisdom believe it

194
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:23,630
or not so the the Chinese have such uh incredible
wisdom by the way those wisdom those those

195
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:31,140
techniques were invented by bodhisattvas

196
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:37,740
okay so that's why the Chinese culture is
very very profound they have they have all

197
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:45,029
these special knowledge that were taught by
the enlightened people who came to China to

198
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:53,580
help the Chinese people help the Asians okay
and now that the Asians becoming caucAsians

199
00:28:53,580 --> 00:29:01,130
no one knows about them anymore you see so
it's more like an Asian thing yeah

200
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:05,559
we're born too late

201
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:14,070
so anyway so this is this uh so so this uh
this uh YiJing here is incredibly precise

202
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:21,100
so I know of another Vietnamese guy who also
uh is a believer in this guy who who practices

203
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:31,370
YiJing as well and what this Vietnamese guy
he used to be an engineer you might be interested

204
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:39,200
in this Qun he used to be a meChanical engineer
in los angeles this is about 20 years ago

205
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,640
okay like he graduated from UC San Diego or
something and worked as a mechanical engineer

206
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:55,100
in the area and then his older brother introduced
him to his his acquaintance who's a martial

207
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:02,419
arts teacher who specializes in studying the
YiJing and you know a martial arts teacher

208
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:08,890
XiaoTai they're not very rich you know you
know they don't have a lot of money all the

209
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,919
money is in the dojo and the clothes they
wear you know they buy from you know they

210
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:21,510
so anyway so this this guy here doesn't have
money but he specializes in YiJing so he says

211
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:30,480
you know what since you work for uh Qualcomm
okay Qualcomm okay do I yeah did I pronounce

212
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,080
it right

213
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:39,140
now yesterday you know Qun showed me this
app here in google app about how to pronounce

214
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:46,590
things properly and I'm so self-conscious
did I pronounce it right

215
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:54,299
so he he he says you have a little bit of money so
let me let's make a deal okay I will show

216
00:30:54,299 --> 00:31:01,710
you okay the Qualcomm stock prices movement

217
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:08,431
so this guy here started borrowing money to
buy this Qualcomm stocks and then sell at

218
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:14,840
the right time and and then wait and then
buy them again and then sell more and he just

219
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:21,440
looked at one stock and just waited and waited
and waited until it drops and goes up up

220
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:29,059
and down up and down so what he did is this
engineer told us told my brother he says he

221
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:37,149
is so accurate he says it will go to get to
46 dollars and then it goes up to 52 sell

222
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:43,600
it because it's gonna drop and it drops okay
you walk you wait until it's uh uh 27 you

223
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,899
buy it because it's gonna go and start going
up that's how precise he was can you imagine

224
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:55,130
so that kid engineer mechanical engineer i
met him he retired at the age of you know

225
00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:03,880
31 or 32. he's like worth a lot of money back
then he's worth like 15 million dollars

226
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,140
that's a lot of houses in San Jose nowadays

227
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:17,080
how about that so that that the instruction
are so precise the people with wisdom people

228
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:24,710
who really know they tell us exactly what
to do there's no ambiguity about it ambiguity

229
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:30,409
am I correct uh never mind so that's what
instructions are the enlightened people the

230
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:41,750
instructions say do this and do that okay
uh do it right now okay so you see it is so

231
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:49,260
precise instructions to get there and your
cultivation is very detailed very very precise

232
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:58,059
there's no ambiguity and then furthermore
that's instruction and lead you what is leading

233
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,960
leading means that

234
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:12,110
two things they know the way okay they know
the way and number two they encourage you

235
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:19,679
a leader is a person uh uh is it is
it fair to say as leader as person who knows

236
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:29,720
how to encourage her people her follower her
employees subordinates oh no

237
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,649
it's not about arguing it's not about proving
you are right about encouraging leading them in

238
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:38,179
the right direction

239
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:46,350
okay so this is what this is what a good knowing
advisor does he has the detailed knowledge

240
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:55,029
accurate knowledge on how to do it and they
know how to lead you encourage you and and

241
00:33:55,029 --> 00:34:04,409
and guide you to see your nature

242
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:12,929
okay and you might wonder why they want to
do this okay if you have someone become enlightened

243
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:24,770
your blessings are incredible okay you you
incredibly rich they have incredible blessings

244
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:32,339
that's why okay they do not only for you but
ultimately first of all they do it for you

245
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:41,500
but ultimately once but if they do it selflessly
their rewards their blessings are out of this

246
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:50,230
world so that's why these people when they
help us it's a it's uh really selfless they're

247
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:56,320
not they have no ulterior motives okay it's
like when I look at you especially Vietnamese

248
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,890
people I come near you and look at me say
what are you up to sound familiar you know

249
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:06,869
what are you trying to do

250
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:11,280
nothing okay

251
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:21,490
you find out little girl when you get older
okay 184 sutra text if you're one who enlightened

252
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:29,109
himself you need not seek outside if you insist
that it is necessary to seek a good knowing advisor

253
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:49,839
in the hope of obtaining liberation you're
mistaken why

254
00:35:49,839 --> 00:36:02,430
okay 185. so the great teacher continues he
says if you are the one who can figure out

255
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,099
how to become enlightened yourself

256
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:13,680
okay if you are able to do that then you're
not not you need not seek outside what is

257
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,880
not need no need to seek outside what does
it mean it means that you don't need to go

258
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:28,380
look for someone's help anyone else's help
okay you can if you're able to enlighten yourself

259
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:34,210
then you look inside you you will figure it
out by looking inside not going out and asking

260
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:40,339
someone else to help you

261
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:48,030
that is if you're able to enlighten yourself
all right on the other hand if you insist

262
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:53,760
that it is necessary to seek a good knowing advisor
in the hope of obtaining liberation you're

263
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:03,540
mistaken why and furthermore uh master HuiNeng says if you insist because you keep on hearing

264
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:08,490
from the Chinese from the people before you
said you should look for good knowing advisor

265
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:17,120
that's the Chan wisdom okay and that's how
you best can hope to attain liberation to

266
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:24,410
become enlightened obtain liberation means
you liberate from your mediocrity you liberate

267
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:30,940
yourself from your own self-imposed suffering

268
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:37,210
the suffering that you undergoing right now
you are doing right now are self-imposed did

269
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:46,890
you know that no one else is making you suffer
but yourself you did it to yourself you're

270
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:53,010
doing to yourself okay you don't realize and
what happens I talked to one of my disciples

271
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:59,690
recently and she says you know it's uh my
partner's fault you know she keeps on talk

272
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:09,710
telling me uh what her partner does wrong
okay so it's always someone else's fault and

273
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:15,770
she doesn't realize that the

274
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:22,270
she's the one who's making herself endure
all the suffering it's no talking to her okay

275
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:26,210
and that's what happened to you

276
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:37,640
people who are too smart too educated okay
you only you only believe in your own mind

277
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:48,140
okay and and you in particular you can't even
see that you are tormenting yourself you're

278
00:38:48,140 --> 00:39:02,530
creating all this suffering yourself all the
suffering again are self-created

279
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:10,930
okay that ego of yours is a real culprit the
ego of yours the existence of a self is the

280
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:18,360
source of all the suffering in your life

281
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:29,869
until you wake up to that you will not be
able to attain liberation so Buddhists pursuits

282
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:41,680
Buddhist wisdom Buddhist training is about
knowing how to get rid of that ego of ours

283
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,829
that is the cause of all our suffering and
the question a fair question to ask is once

284
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:53,640
you get rid of your ego what happens to you

285
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
what happens to you

286
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:03,210
then you're going to get married and be happy
right Daniel

287
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:20,550
if you put an end to your own ego you will
never suffer again you only know bliss and

288
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:28,260
peace in your life people keep on telling
me I keep hearing about this he said I would

289
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:37,880
like to have a I really appreciate it when
I have a moment one moment of peace during

290
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:47,380
the day sounds familiar the whole day for
us is all turmoil it's all it's so turbulent

291
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:57,579
it's one worry another after another excuse
me and and the turmoil the turbulence are

292
00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:06,540
created uh by your egos you you constantly
are grabbing this and grabbing that okay you

293
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:12,349
cannot help yourself you greedy for this you
greedy for that you upset at this person

294
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:16,329
upset at the other person upset at the kid you
know and so forth

295
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:27,599
because they're not the way you expect them
to be okay you remember notice that expression

296
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,170
you expect them to be who expects them to
be your ego expects them to be and what you

297
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:37,710
do you keep on blaming others for your own
misery

298
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:41,500
when are you going to wake up to that

299
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:50,540
okay and and that's your problem you cannot
you don't realize that you don't know how

300
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:59,660
to rein in your ego to rein in your desires
to rein in your

301
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:10,810
your arrogance okay and and so that's why
you you suffer so liberation is a concept

302
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:17,890
it says uh the different types of liberations
as you practice the spiritual practice whether

303
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:26,170
it's Buddhism whether it's Daoism whether
it's Catholicism as you increase your skills

304
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:35,630
level concentration level you naturally will
have will experience certain different types

305
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:42,510
of liberation so in Buddhism it's very precise
when you reach different levels of concentration

306
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:49,609
each level is associated with a degree of
liberation until you reach the highest level

307
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:59,030
of samadhi that's when you are totally free
you attain total liberation you'll never suffer

308
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:03,150
again

309
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,940
even though when your wife yells at you

310
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:19,040
not funny oh yeah it's possible okay so he
says if you think it's necessary uh to seek

311
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:25,980
a good knowing advisor remember he says he said
go look for a good knowing advisor but he says now if you insist 

312
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:32,040
it's necessary to look for good
new advisor in order to attain liberation

313
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:40,869
to free yourself and put an end to all your
suffering you're mistaken why 186. within

314
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:50,839
your own mind there is self-enlightenment
which is a knowing advisor

315
00:43:50,839 --> 00:44:01,609
okay why are you not supposed to seek a good
knowing advisor because he says within your mind

316
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:10,119
right now the mind you have right now nowhere
else okay not in mine not in hers it's your

317
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:19,930
mind now okay uh there is self-enlightenment
that mind of yours contain uh

318
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:27,740
enlightenment this mind of yours can enlighten
yourself which is a knowing advisor meaning

319
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,250
it knows how to enlighten yourself

320
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:40,040
go ahead it says I don't believe

321
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:45,270
anyone has any problems with this

322
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:46,270
yes yellow

323
00:44:46,270 --> 00:45:30,280
[Question in Vietnamese]

325
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:37,530
amituofo master, so everybody in each of our self all
have something called the conscience mind

326
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:46,400
and when that conscience mind when we do something
wrong that conscience mind will be um we will

327
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:53,380
feel ashamed and we will feel regret so if
a person who lives fully completely within

328
00:45:53,380 --> 00:46:01,119
their own conscious mind doesn't mean that
they can become enlightened

329
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:11,050
it's possible but very unlikely most likely
a person who lives in in with a guilty conscience

330
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:21,140
will end up being depressed

331
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:31,839
okay so enlightenment is a lot more than just
a guilty conscience

332
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:42,260
okay but having a guilty conscience is definitely
very helpful towards becoming enlightened

333
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:49,819
okay and so uh what he's talking about here
what master HuiNeng is talking about here is

334
00:46:49,819 --> 00:46:55,280
that when you become enlightened

335
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,410
the moment you become enlightened when you
become enlightened how does it happen

336
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:21,490
how?

337
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:30,710
microphone no color uh you listen to your
inner good knowing advisor you listen your inner

338
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:36,800
enlightened thing very creative how you listen
your inner enlightened nature

339
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:48,120
clearly this person doesn't know what she's
talking about because you know when you say

340
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:56,220
something you have to do say emphatically
you say you listen your own nature you say

341
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:03,240
you you you recognize it and then you follow
it

342
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:12,349
you recognize and then what the and then follow it
and then follow it

343
00:48:12,349 --> 00:48:13,349
trying to google

344
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:24,290
[Laughter]

345
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:31,309
okay follow it okay

346
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:36,890
so you listen your enlightened mind you follow
it are you sure

347
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:38,480
um

348
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:49,980
it doesn't quite work like that okay

349
00:48:49,980 --> 00:49:00,400
who recognizes your enlightenment

350
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:10,780
who recognizes it

351
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:21,050
who who sees his own nature her own nature

352
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:35,309
what happened at that moment

353
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:49,089
well I have all day I am have nowhere else
to go go ahead Wei mountain

354
00:49:49,089 --> 00:49:58,200
the Korean got up this early
and then they said I don't know master I'm so

355
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:08,180
sleepy can you just speed it up a little we
we're trying to stay awake here

356
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,720
yeah Wei Mountain go ahead

357
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:21,600
four o'clock on sunday morning they're listening
to sutra lectures Koreans are weird

358
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:28,359
yeah master I don't I don't know what happens
because I'm not enlightened but I've heard

359
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:33,400
you say that when someone becomes enlightened
there's an earthquake but no one gets hurt

360
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:40,730
by the earthquake

361
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:42,340
an earthquake that hurts no one

362
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:56,650
well that's why it hurt too that's all I did
is I regurgitated that

363
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:57,650
any anything else

364
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:09,700
okay suffice to tell you this okay when
is your turn to become enlightened this is

365
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:14,410
what's going to happen and if it doesn't help
please uh doesn't happen please don't sue

366
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:23,420
me okay it's just it's just a free a free
offering okay like google hey I could be wrong

367
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:34,569
too when you become enlightened how
do you see your nature

368
00:51:34,569 --> 00:51:44,089
your self nature sees itself it's that simple
who else can see it right it's no one else

369
00:51:44,089 --> 00:51:50,119
it's not like one of them say hey I can see
you your self-nature no at that very moment

370
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:59,630
you become enlightened your self nature sees
itself am I making sense to you

371
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:04,510
who else gonna see it for you some kind of
short Asian guy

372
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:14,040
huh of course not you have to see yourself
so at that moment here's what happened at

373
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:19,860
that very moment you become enlightened and
the technical jargon means at the moment you

374
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:28,650
see your nature what it really is talking
about your self your own self nature sees

375
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:31,760
itself

376
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,589
okay

377
00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:35,589
that's all it means

378
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:43,859
it sees itself and what does it mean when
you see itself when your self nature sees

379
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:44,859
itself

380
00:52:44,859 --> 00:52:55,260
hm what does it mean oh god you don't know
anything do you oh how can you live like this

381
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,829
huh

382
00:52:58,829 --> 00:53:02,829
yes sir what happens when he says the self
nature sees itself yes

383
00:53:02,829 --> 00:54:16,859
[Master XianChi Speaking in Vietnamese]

387
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:35,210
amituofo master, um so I have been applying this
to me I feel that it is not hard it is not

388
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:43,220
easy just like venerable HuiNeng taught venerable
HuiMing is this um

389
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:53,890
I don't know how to translate that Ping Xin. At that
moment, there's no the mind of non-discriminating

390
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:59,920
the mind of non-discrimination
at that moment there's no thought of evil

391
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:06,609
no thought of goodness so right at that time
it is your own original mind and venerable

392
00:55:06,609 --> 00:55:13,500
HuiMing asked venerable HuiNeng again is that is there
any other secret and venerable HuiNeng and say

393
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:20,410
no the secret lies within you so if you practice
to the point that you can sustain the thought

394
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:27,420
of no evil and no goodness for a long time
then your good knowing advisor will certify

395
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:35,020
you as becoming enlightened and if you still
have this mind of good and evil it's just

396
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:43,160
like the banner the float with the wind and
this is how I perceive it okay very good let

397
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:49,460
me explain the process for you so that it
removes a little a little bit of the mystery

398
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:56,230
from all these Chinese talk about enlightenment
and so forth or other caucAsians or Westerners

399
00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:04,770
talk about enlightenment and will help you
understand what is plausible what's not okay

400
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:11,109
the Westerners you talk to a lot of people
or not just the Westerners also a lot of uh

401
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:18,380
quack Asians who says I'm enlightened okay
especially a lot of monks and nuns who says

402
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:25,140
I'm enlightened I've seen enlightenment i
know about enlightenment okay and they don't

403
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:32,630
know what they're talking about because that's
not how it works okay the way it works is

404
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:39,359
that for you to become enlightened look at
the history of how master HuiNeng became enlightened

405
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:44,579
how master XuanHua become enlightened all the
people before them became enlightened Buddhas

406
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:47,589
how Buddhas became enlightened what are the requirements

407
00:56:47,589 --> 00:56:55,280
there's one requirement

408
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:03,950
what is it hmm what is that one requirement
that's a one common denominator all to all

409
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:06,520
of them

410
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:12,720
now the Vietnamese are excited yes

411
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:25,130
[Answer in Vietnamese]

412
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:35,490
amituofo master, to me there's the the only
requirement that happened at that time is

413
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:44,440
you let go there's no such discrimination
okay old monk what do they all do? at that moment

414
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,490
no thought arise

415
00:57:48,490 --> 00:58:08,930
no thought arise, very good. Wei Mountain.

416
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:17,160

are you too sleepy I thought I helped you
wake up and say hey what happens what is the

418
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:35,030
same common denominator that you Koreans also
must do to experience that moment

419
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:42,869
go ahead short uh Vietnamese amituofo
master, I think one condition is that look

[Laughter] don't let your people down

425
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:31,339

they

427
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:38,000

in order for you to open your wisdom you must
meditate

467
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:20,380
isn't that wonderful that's what we've been
teaching you you do ceremony you call it chanting

468
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:29,300
we call it actually it's a form of meditation

469
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:39,039
you see that meditate okay so this
is key this is why in Buddhism we put so much

470
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:46,170
emphasis on teaching you about about meditation
how to meditate because ultimately when you

471
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:55,849
get there at the moment you you become a Buddha
you have to meditate okay and then you will

472
01:05:55,849 --> 01:06:05,150
have no thought you would drop it you stop
and so forth but that is a state of meditation

473
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:10,890
is it clear you have to meditate this is why
you meditate meditate meditate and one day

474
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:18,750
say boom at that very moment what happens
your self nature recognize itself oh

475
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:25,580
wow that's my self nature and how do you see
it because your self nature sees itself you

476
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:31,819
know that and that moment what happens that
why why is that moment is very important this

477
01:06:31,819 --> 01:06:37,180
is so critical this is and I don't know why
the Chinese or Koreans didn't teach their

478
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,180
disciples

479
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:48,940
huh see he's so excited see I'm so excited
he's so excited too here's what happens okay

480
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:54,119
what happened is that you meditate meditate
meditate that moment your self-nature says

481
01:06:54,119 --> 01:07:02,950
wow hey that's that's mine that's my self
nature right there so that very moment because

482
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:08,470
your meditation your self nature

483
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:18,740
sees itself and what it means is that because
of meditation you have the technique on how

484
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:28,010
to activate your self-nature to see

485
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:32,880
so it's not something haphazard at all the
Buddha when he became a Buddha he sat

486
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:40,480
on the bodhi tree for 49 days right he says
if I don't become a Buddha I will not I will

487
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,980
never get up from this from from from uh from
my meditation he will never get out of here okay

488
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:53,680
so after 49 days he who is meditating all
sudden he saw something uh a light you

489
01:07:53,680 --> 01:08:05,180
know a a a star flying by okay in the sky
okay and boom at that moment there his self

490
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:14,910
nature saw itself it's oh that's it and because
of that okay because of that he developed

491
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:23,420
he remembered how to do it whereas now you
have you do it occasionally you know you do

492
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:28,230
it like Vietnamese says []

493
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:35,170
okay meaning that you know Vietnamese has
a very very uh ex expression that says []

494
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:42,280
meaning a dog catches the fly uh by Chance
you know he was yawning and then he's yawning

495
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:48,170
and then whoop and he catches the fly so what happens is 
you he'll never be able to do it again

496
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:55,130
you see that's what it means it's a haphazard
thing and whereas in Buddhism you develop

497
01:08:55,130 --> 01:09:01,500
you train you day in day out train you help
you and cajole you and encourage you and

498
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:06,230
threaten you and beat you up and insult you
you know and praise you and all those things

499
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:14,759
are called leading we talked about earlier
remember he says will instruct and lead you

500
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:20,100
all that's called leadership you understand
sometimes you yell at them sometimes you smile

501
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:24,870
at them sometimes you have to cry sometimes
you have to give up sometimes whatever all

502
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:26,080
those are called leading

503
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:35,630
and it gets you going going and then one
some point in time boom you see it and say

504
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:41,710
wow I know how to do it now

505
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:47,210
and that's why it's so important that's why
this meditation things here you don't understand

506
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:53,359
you don't realize what we are doing is we
are leading you to develop the skills for

507
01:09:53,359 --> 01:10:01,780
you to do it consistently not like a [] 
you have to remember this expression

508
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:07,010
Vietnamese expression the dog that catches
the fly

509
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:14,820
through yawning

510
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:23,840
got that Korean did your sunims teach you
that that's what happens this is why you have

511
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,469
to go to the come to the temple that's why
you have to meditate every day because you're

512
01:10:28,469 --> 01:10:31,620
developing the skills to do it consistently

513
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:39,390
understand now

514
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:45,120
it's a skill it's not something haphazard
something by chance it's a skill that you

515
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:49,550
need to develop the ability to do

516
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:53,140
consistently

517
01:10:53,140 --> 01:11:01,140
okay right now you're able to occasionally
do that but you don't realize it's you whereas

518
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:06,219
because through meditation training you go
through this training process you meditate

519
01:11:06,219 --> 01:11:11,470
meditate and then say wow it happens oh that's
how I did it

520
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:21,520
so the moment you see your nature that moment
there you recognize it oh wow that's me i

521
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:27,800
did it whereas now when you use your nature
and you see you know part of your nature and

522
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:32,940
you see a partial picture you have no clue
what it is you cannot tell the difference

523
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:37,940
is that clear it's not you cannot do right
now you can you can do it too but you

524
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:43,780
cannot do it consistently and you cannot do
it at will

525
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:51,750
after you become after that moment when you
see your nature you're able to do it consistently

526
01:11:51,750 --> 01:12:00,230
so meaning that when you need to to liberate
yourself and rise above suffering boom you

527
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:05,780
can do it at will

528
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:09,620
whereas right now you say I don't know why
I'm crying I don't know why I'm suffering

529
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:15,870
so much if you have that skill you say
what suffering instantaneously

530
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:18,820
you're

531
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:27,949
free you rise above all this suffering
all these nonsense

532
01:12:27,949 --> 01:12:38,350
instantaneously 
what happened to the applause sign wait a

533
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:42,159
minute this is like

534
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:47,449
one person

535
01:12:47,449 --> 01:13:04,350
this is a state secret

536
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:10,639
okay Jumi now you go back to sleep okay
look at that poor women oh my god I'm so sleepy

537
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:18,639
I'm so sleepy can I go back to bed please

538
01:13:18,639 --> 01:13:25,300
okay all right oh god yeah it's just like
trying to explain to you this is so hard I'm

539
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:32,150
so tired now look at all your really really
stop uh uh no thought uh

540
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:48,500
after all these years I've been doing this
for 16 years and this is all you got

541
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:53,190
okay next should we continue or should we stop
I'm tired

542
01:13:53,190 --> 01:14:02,340
if 
you are one who enlightens himself you need

543
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:12,800
not seek outside oh why am I still here okay
next uh next who is moving my slides within

544
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:17,389
your own mind there's self enlightenment which
is a knowing advisor okay remember this is where

545
01:14:17,389 --> 01:14:23,550
why I explained to you that very moment when
you meditate when you see your nature that's

546
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:30,889
what he's referring to is that clear when
you get there you know that very moment that's

547
01:14:30,889 --> 01:14:37,239
why at that very moment you know these people
who are enlightened they know

548
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:46,510
what happened is the people below that level
they are not enlightened but they falsely

549
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:51,570
think and that's why it's very dangerous

550
01:14:51,570 --> 01:15:01,220
i met too many people who are mistakenly in
the belief that they are enlightened they

551
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:10,659
haven't seen your nature yet okay you can
tell immediately from their comportment yes

552
01:15:10,659 --> 01:15:18,310
master is the definition of meditation here
beyond just sitting since I think some in

553
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:27,449
some of the stories meditation is to learn how to concentrate
when we teach you meditation we start by teaching

554
01:15:27,449 --> 01:15:35,210
you to cross your legs sitting meditation
but eventually you understand that meditation

555
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:46,510
is 24 hours a day you can do it anytime you
don't need to cross your legs anymore okay

556
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:54,300
but crossing your legs is the quickest way
to develop your meditation skills so you cannot

557
01:15:54,300 --> 01:16:00,400
say that I don't I don't need to cross my
legs because it's not necessary it's not true

558
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:04,360
it's necessary for you

559
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:09,890
you have to have the skills to cross your
legs first okay

560
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:19,490
188 but if you give rise to deviant confusion
false thoughts and perversions although a

561
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:32,670
good knowing advisor external external to you
instructs you he cannot save 

562
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:36,130
you

563
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:45,660
okay now he's giving us a caution a warning
he says you may have a good knowing advisor here's

564
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:54,980
the danger you have to be careful and this
is what happened to uh XiaoTai is here cover his

565
01:16:54,980 --> 01:17:05,929
ears up happens to the word begins with an
"L"

566
01:17:05,929 --> 01:17:14,580
lion there you go very good

567
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:20,251
okay here's what happens you may have a great
teacher like master XuanHua or master

568
01:17:20,251 --> 01:17:29,090
HuiNeng okay okay but if you give rise to deviant
confusion false thoughts and perversions what

569
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:38,090
are they these are very important words of
warning to caution you because these are the

570
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:45,320
aspects that will lead you astray and doesn't
matter who you learn from where you are who

571
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:53,429
you are how far you got okay you will get
in trouble

572
01:17:53,429 --> 01:18:03,840
okay if you still harbor give rise to means
harbor you still have it in your heart in

573
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:11,909
your mind you still believe these things okay
that's how they give rise they give rise meaning

574
01:18:11,909 --> 01:18:20,410
it comes from you you believe you believe
it what do you believe you have you have deviant

575
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:30,290
beliefs you have you have false thoughts you
have perversions okay deviant meaning that

576
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:37,280
you don't believe in cause and effect okay
people who do not believe in cause and effect

577
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:51,370
they will get in trouble eventually they cannot
become enlightened cannot it's hopeless okay

578
01:18:51,370 --> 01:19:04,040
confusion uh Xie Mi, confusion is that your
mind is dark you cannot recognize uh things

579
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:12,250
that they are you mistaken about things perversion
perversion meaning that there are different

580
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:15,530
perversions

581
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:24,790
perversions meaning that by definition perversions
are you are in contradiction to the

582
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:33,930
principles the proper principles okay what
are the proper principles uh the four of them

583
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:40,060
number one okay there

584
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:49,530
this body is impure don't be so attached to
this body of yours you so attach to your body

585
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:54,460
is upside-down view

586
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,440
know anyone who has upside-down views

587
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:05,290
all of you

588
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:16,850
attachment to the body okay yeah uh number
one and number two uh feelings your feelings

589
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:23,560
uh you cherish your feelings

590
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:30,510
okay you think feelings are cool for example
you seek feelings of pleasure you seek feelings

591
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:39,810
of pain for some people

592
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:48,710
okay so Jumi you seek pleasure you seek pain

593
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:54,280
she's sleeping

594
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,050
do you seek pain or you seek pleasure

595
01:20:56,050 --> 01:21:28,120
[Jumi answer in Korean]

596
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:36,659
I thought about what I'm attached to and I
I found out that I am attached to the comfort

597
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:49,719
and nothing happened okay so she's attached
to pleasure okay therefore she is upside-down

598
01:21:49,719 --> 01:21:53,710
okay very good

599
01:21:53,710 --> 01:22:03,060
anyone attached to pain in Korea

601
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:11,310
no one in Korea is attached to pain

602
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:15,480
they would never admit it how about us Americans
anyone of you attached to pain

603
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:21,850
[Laughter] XiaoTai attach to pain seriously

604
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:33,850
[Laughter] uh okay so uh that's uh that's
what is feelings you attach to feelings and

605
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:42,010
that's uh uh you you you you seek feelings
of pleasure you seek feelings of pain and

606
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:48,010
that's upside-down number three

607
01:22:48,010 --> 01:23:00,219
you think that your your mind is permanent
meaning for example you say I love my husband

608
01:23:00,219 --> 01:23:12,570
and we will be forever it's so untrue yes
no

609
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:20,250
okay so the mind is impermanent and yet and
yet you think the mind will be forever

610
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:32,900
okay and finally there's no self, dharma has
no self, meaning everything has no self whatsoever

611
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:42,440
everything is um is uh yes it has a has no
self everything is empty okay so if you can't

612
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:51,400
violate those four things then you are considered
upside-down all right false thoughts the false

613
01:23:51,400 --> 01:24:00,360
thoughts are the thinking that arise when
you meditate for example you're meditating

614
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:07,980
you reciting the Buddha's name also one other thought arises
that's called a false thought okay so the

615
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:12,889
caveat the warning here is that if

616
01:24:12,889 --> 01:24:26,800
you give rise to deviancy false belief confusion
you're confused by marks by external things

617
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:38,219
you have false thinking okay and you are have
perversions okay then here's what happens

618
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:47,320
if you do that you still have that although
there's a good knowing advisor outside of you

619
01:24:47,320 --> 01:25:07,010
instructs you he cannot save you

620
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:17,040
is that clear the good knowing advisor may have
wisdom may be a Buddha but if you insist on

621
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:28,980
harboring deviancy confused about external
things you keep on you cherish thinking and

622
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:37,710
you are confused about principles then no
one can save you no matter how wise and smart

623
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:48,050
they are no matter how hard they try they
cannot save you

624
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:58,150
and this is a fallacy of spiritual cultivation
people they cultivate they recite the Buddha's

625
01:25:58,150 --> 01:26:07,830
name for 20 30 years okay for a lifetime after
lifetime what they failed to do is to get

626
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:13,880
rid of deviancy get rid of confusion get rid
of false thinking and rid of perversion that's

627
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:21,610
why they will never become enlightened you
can meditate all you want

628
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:27,210
but you don't get rid of these things you
will never be able to do it you may have may

629
01:26:27,210 --> 01:26:34,870
have the greatest teacher but you eventually
will fall off by the wayside that's it and

630
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:44,699
that's why what I've been watching for the
last 16 years so many of these people okay

631
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:50,850
give an example first newcomers they first
come and

632
01:26:50,850 --> 01:27:02,560
they are deviant they said I don't believe
in cause and effect I believe in the power

633
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:12,909
of money I believe in I believe in the fact
that this life once it's life is uh is is

634
01:27:12,909 --> 01:27:20,850
over it doesn't matter everything returned
to dust okay all those are deviant beliefs

635
01:27:20,850 --> 01:27:28,679
such people who came they are gone very very
quickly

636
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:36,690
all right be careful and then furthermore
there are a lot of people who came to our

637
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:48,139
temple who practice for years but deep down
they harbor these beliefs okay they are uh

638
01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:55,260
looking for for example spiritual penetration
they said oh my god I can see this I can I

639
01:27:55,260 --> 01:28:02,659
can see that okay I love to see I'd love to
see see this I'd love to be able to do that

640
01:28:02,659 --> 01:28:10,159
okay and they're confused about the fact that
all those things are not never the goals of

641
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:11,159
meditation

642
01:28:11,159 --> 01:28:19,699
and therefore they get excited because with
meditation they're able to to do it

643
01:28:19,699 --> 01:28:27,139
better to see things more things you see it
more frequently okay and they believe more

644
01:28:27,139 --> 01:28:33,880
and more in themselves it's called confusion

645
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:41,560
the more they improve the more they can see
and the more they really think that they are

646
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:46,970
so special

647
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:56,619
okay so they came with these beliefs that
they learn all these things so that they are

648
01:28:56,619 --> 01:29:01,699
become even more special than before so the
ego becomes bigger

649
01:29:01,699 --> 01:29:11,390
and that's confusion go ahead JMT

650
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:24,800
people are depressed are they looking for
pain pain repeat the question

651
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:33,420
uh when people are depressed uh are they looking
for pain when they're depressed are they looking

652
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:41,960
for pain attac-attached to pain are they
attached to pain

653
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:47,030
I don't know I'm never depressed anyone's
depressed help me out please when you depressed

654
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:51,909

back like alcoholism like drug addiction it'll

658
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:18,510

659
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:25,369
okay are they looking for pain are you looking
for pain when you're depressed she says no

660
01:30:25,369 --> 01:30:36,580

661
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:45,400
no or yes I cannot tell your movement now is
so subtle

662
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:53,739
there is uh I think there's some attachment
to attachment to pain

663
01:30:53,739 --> 01:31:02,290
to yeah to the feeling of getting depressed

664
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:10,510
you're weird anyway anyone else huh Wei Mountain
what happens when you're depressed are you

665
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:16,989
attached to pain oh oh thank you master, I
thought he said are you attached to a pen

666
01:31:16,989 --> 01:31:28,060
[Laughter] because when I've been depressed
I find a pen is very helpful it helps me write

667
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:32,869
things down and kind of get them out of my
head you know if I can't find a pen then uh

668
01:31:32,869 --> 01:31:40,969
okay let's not muddy up the water again you're
not helping okay anyone else uh Wei Mountain

669
01:31:40,969 --> 01:31:42,880
go ahead good lord

670
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:53,960
go um I think depressed people are not attached
to pain they just want to get the pain over

671
01:31:53,960 --> 01:32:01,420
so at that dependency you feel pleasure about
feeling pain come on man come on Daniel be

672
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:08,950
assert yourself don't be so Catholic say don't
say don't say I don't start with "I think". no just

673
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:19,980
say No, they don't. No, they aren't, okay? come
on let's be a macho man yeah are you attached

674
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:27,000
to pain when you're depressed I actually experienced
depression last year oh no not not attached

675
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:33,340
but suffered from depression suffer from depression
I guess the reason was I was so obsessed with

676
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:38,739
get rid of the feeling of being depressed
right and the process of trying to push it

677
01:32:38,739 --> 01:32:44,140
away make me actually more depressed yeah
that's my yeah personal experience but you

678
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:49,869
know attached to pain no I guess I'm attached
to get rid of pain right right maybe okay

679
01:32:49,869 --> 01:33:01,540
that's more not too much not like depends
what is that huh okay no no depressed

680
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:09,909
people are not attached to pain in general
of course they always uh uh uh exceptions

681
01:33:09,909 --> 01:33:17,699
okay in Korea okay there will be exceptions
but in America most people who are depressed

682
01:33:17,699 --> 01:33:26,100
they're not attached to pain at all actually
they're in pain they don't like it they hate

683
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:33,780
it but they cannot do anything about it they
don't know what to do about them

684
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:37,570
sounds familiar

685
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:44,730
okay remember when you're depressed and you're
in such great pain you feel so in pain and

686
01:33:44,730 --> 01:33:50,270
you just don't know what to do to snap out
of it so they're not attached at all they

687
01:33:50,270 --> 01:33:56,119
just are totally

688
01:33:56,119 --> 01:34:02,810
under the spell they're victims of the state of
depression this is why I'm reminding you if

689
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:08,970
you know you have severe depression you better
go get help because you won't be able to handle

690
01:34:08,970 --> 01:34:17,520
it that's a typical case where when you are
in a state of depression you will find reason

691
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:23,800
for you not to do anything and and so forth
and you have to pre-program yourself and before

692
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:30,170
you get depressed then you need to go seek
help because it's way beyond you I'll give

693
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:40,989
an example when I I'm sorry I bring it out
right now okay uh you know I've been uh trying

694
01:34:40,989 --> 01:34:48,510
to fix uh the uh temple in San Francisco we
do remodeling okay finalizing the you know

695
01:34:48,510 --> 01:34:58,679
little things here and there and uh it's a
lot of it's a lot of things a lot of you know

696
01:34:58,679 --> 01:35:05,219
things to take care of small things and it
turns out I have a very a group of very dedicated

697
01:35:05,219 --> 01:35:12,350
people who are trying to help and one of them
is Master XianJie Master XianJie is really among them

698
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:21,280
a few who are very very key uh to the efforts
okay they all took pieces of the work and

699
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:26,909
they are working together to make it happen
and we really appreciate that what what happened

700
01:35:26,909 --> 01:35:35,449
with Master XianJie in particular is that he's
had severe depression his entire life okay

701
01:35:35,449 --> 01:35:44,489
debilitating depression and was very bad before
he became a monk okay and and uh it's getting

702
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:52,850
better and better nowadays okay however I
I declared a long some time ago he's a fourth-stage

703
01:35:52,850 --> 01:36:03,000
arhat okay meaning he's way up there in terms
of Gongfu but every time he under severe

704
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:10,310
depression he's totally not himself

705
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:15,409
you can tell right away you want to look at
him I didn't say anything oh boy you're depressed

706
01:36:15,409 --> 01:36:21,820
again okay and that's what happens because
of the importance of the kind of work I do

707
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:28,909
we do in San Francisco they will come and
try to stop us slow us down and because if

708
01:36:28,909 --> 01:36:34,990
your work is important if you're doing something
important that towards that effort they will

709
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:40,909
come and attack you as well because they cannot
attack me okay so what happened is that I

710
01:36:40,909 --> 01:36:49,600
noticed that these people either they get
injured themselves or they become depressed

711
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:58,300
they become manic uh and so forth and that's
how they stop me okay they slow me down okay

712
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:05,489
so so that is to tell you I'll tell you two
things number one even fourth stage arhats

713
01:37:05,489 --> 01:37:12,060
are helpless against depression if you're
not even fourth stage arhat you really have no

714
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:17,250
chance at all

715
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:18,980
okay

716
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:31,350
uh and uh and the other thing is that um is
that uh

717
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:40,179
when you are in that state okay you need help
and so I have been watching that and I decided

718
01:37:40,179 --> 01:37:50,150
to give the order it's okay to lift them up
immediately yesterday I decided to do that

719
01:37:50,150 --> 01:38:02,940
Master XianJie came to Gold Forest a changed
man did you notice

720
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:03,940
I wanted to

721
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:16,120
let you know that depression can be helped
okay and you need to seek help because even

722
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:24,119
for very strong people very high highly skilled
people have some some real GongFu like fourth

723
01:38:24,119 --> 01:38:37,619
stage arhats they still are helpless against
depression

724
01:38:37,619 --> 01:38:46,199
is a very serious issue and it's not something
that the medical profession should take lightly

725
01:38:46,199 --> 01:38:55,010
but they do because they don't know what to
do with it prescribing medication uh counseling

726
01:38:55,010 --> 01:39:02,179
is not gonna help because you're fighting
an invisible enemy and ghost is so powerful

727
01:39:02,179 --> 01:39:11,550
they pull your strings and they create confusions
in your mind there's nothing you can do that's

728
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:17,060
the truth yes thank you master I have a quick
question

729
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:26,990
the depression is contagious yes I heard a
lot of people say that but I don't know it's

730
01:39:26,990 --> 01:39:30,119
true or not yes

731
01:39:30,119 --> 01:39:36,070
you spend a lot of time near you spend you
are near depressed people like you married

732
01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:46,290
to a depressed person you end up end up most
likely getting depressed yourself because

733
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:55,360
it's ghosts and it goes from this person
to the next very easily

734
01:39:55,360 --> 01:40:05,030
so my next question is what can you do to
prevent contagious you get help

735
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:11,210
you know the reason I bring it up in Buddhism
every time bring you and bring up a problem

736
01:40:11,210 --> 01:40:18,369
is because we have a solution we're not merchants
of doom we're not telling you those things

737
01:40:18,369 --> 01:40:25,670
in order to make you more depressed and we
all tell you this problem because there's

738
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:34,719
solutions for it it's not easy but it's the
only thing that works right now that is far

739
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:41,110
better than meds than medication than therapy
and counseling because you're dealing with

740
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:48,010
invisible beings the the so-called the yin
beings the ghosts and the demons therefore

741
01:40:48,010 --> 01:40:55,840
you must know a way develop a way to deal with
them okay as you get higher levels of samadhi

742
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:05,270
of wisdom then it's a lot more manageable
a lot like become negligible but at low levels

743
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:13,060
it's debilitating you cannot function you
cannot you are not yourself there's nothing

744
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:20,270
you can do that's why you need to get help
and and I'm I brought up master XianJie as

745
01:41:20,270 --> 01:41:27,199
example is to tell you that even with very
experienced and skilled people they still

746
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:30,099
need help

747
01:41:30,099 --> 01:41:38,570
that's how serious it is how difficult it
is okay

748
01:41:38,570 --> 01:41:47,880
and so going back to slide 180 in our temples
I've seen all sorts of people remember I said

749
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:54,780
the newcomers who come with a bad attitude
okay thinking you know it all they're special

750
01:41:54,780 --> 01:42:03,369
they're lawyers doctor and so forth I know everything
I'm successful okay and therefore therefore

751
01:42:03,369 --> 01:42:13,060
they are they leave very quickly they cannot
last because they can never they are not seeking

752
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:22,530
wisdom they are seeking to reinforce the ego such
people don't last very long around us okay

753
01:42:22,530 --> 01:42:29,780
and there's some people who last a lot longer
years and so forth but they harbor these deviant

754
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:37,650
thoughts these confuse thoughts about the process
and and as uh recently there's some people

755
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:43,679
who you know who I declare they have some
you know a arhatship range and so forth and

756
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:49,230
they're able to see this and see that and
so forth and they still fall off by the wayside

757
01:42:49,230 --> 01:42:53,530
because of their deviant confusion

758
01:42:53,530 --> 01:43:06,610
they harbor these they cherish these these
false beliefs that are not Buddhists

759
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:21,969
okay and therefore they have to leave ultimately
okay because their ghosts pull them out before

760
01:43:21,969 --> 01:43:28,000
they can no longer control them before
they leave they would they say oh master is

761
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,849
probably possessed by a ghost

762
01:43:32,849 --> 01:43:37,199
it's the ghost who told them to say so

763
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:45,150
and they're very proud of it oh oh have you
seen the 50 skandhas demons read it master has

764
01:43:45,150 --> 01:43:54,820
got one of them one of those 50 skandhas demons
it's not the first time even master XuanHua's

765
01:43:54,820 --> 01:44:01,489
uh glorious monks also said the same thing
about me

766
01:44:01,489 --> 01:44:08,599
and guess what they're the one who are possessed
by the skandhas demons

767
01:44:08,599 --> 01:44:16,800
okay so if you have all these things be careful
if you insist on these things you say oh master

768
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:20,699
I believe in Buddhism I want to be your spice
and so forth so forth I really believe in

769
01:44:20,699 --> 01:44:25,989
you you know please teach me 42 hands and eyes
give me a lot of mantras that I can you know

770
01:44:25,989 --> 01:44:30,800
I can help you in the future okay and then
they say I'm going to be a big shot I want

771
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:39,989
to be you know I'm going to be better you
know I'm I'm gonna uh uh oh oh I'm gonna be

772
01:44:39,989 --> 01:44:47,619
glorious and and and open my spiritual penetration
so forth uh because I'm better than him already

773
01:44:47,619 --> 01:44:48,619
okay

774
01:44:48,619 --> 01:44:56,580
they fall off eventually

775
01:44:56,580 --> 01:45:00,560
okay this is what happens

776
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:13,910
180 190 although there's a good knowing advisor
next to you who's trying to teach you he cannot

777
01:45:13,910 --> 01:45:27,530
save you you doing it to yourself

778
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:28,530
you know such people

779
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:41,050
those are the ones who left and the ones who
are leaving

780
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:55,929
because they secretly harbor deviancy confusion
false thinking and perversions and they put

781
01:45:55,929 --> 01:45:59,780
on a facade

782
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:03,719
you cannot fool yourself

783
01:46:03,719 --> 01:46:14,229
you're shooting yourself in the foot that's
all

784
01:46:14,229 --> 01:46:20,610
so watch out you see these people that's why
we don't keep on insisting to you you look

785
01:46:20,610 --> 01:46:30,119
we do Chan meditation do not look for spiritual
penetrations all this is to reduce your ego

786
01:46:30,119 --> 01:46:35,000
not make you ego bigger

787
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:42,989
okay all there are you watch those people
the people the "L people" so we call "L people"

788
01:46:42,989 --> 01:46:55,739
from now on okay those "L people" they this
is what describes them

789
01:46:55,739 --> 01:47:00,990
this is their downfall

790
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:09,199
and you don't need to do anything there's plenty
of people like that just watch them you don't

791
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:23,320
believe me watch them if they fit this description
they will fall off

792
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:28,989
questions comments

793
01:47:28,989 --> 01:47:32,860
yes

794
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:39,400
master, you you you said that we are all uh
we all fall into the category of having upside

795
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:48,830
upside-down views right so uh what you just
said about is that include yeah everybody

796
01:47:48,830 --> 01:47:56,780
of course you will have deviancy of course you
have some confusion you have false thoughts

797
01:47:56,780 --> 01:48:07,050
you have perversions of course we all do okay
but the difference is that such "L people"

798
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:15,450
they cherish it and they say I don't buy what
master says master says don't be so attached

799
01:48:15,450 --> 01:48:22,760
to your visions don't feel so attached to
your knowledge and especially don't be so

800
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:33,690
attached to your ego there they say yeah masters
you know I disagree that's what happened and

801
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:41,199
they disguise it okay they say oh yes yes
yes yes yes you're right you're right you're

802
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:46,060
right but deep down inside they said nah you
don't know what you're talking about and they

803
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:51,139
shoot themselves on the foot

804
01:48:51,139 --> 01:48:58,219
it's not about me knowing whether I know or
not doesn't matter this is about you if you

805
01:48:58,219 --> 01:49:07,849
harbor deviancy harbor confusion false thoughts
perversions and you that make you disagree

806
01:49:07,849 --> 01:49:16,620
big time with my instructions you'll get in
is trouble clear okay not just these generals

807
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:25,190
of course we all have we all make mistakes
but these people really believe that they're

808
01:49:25,190 --> 01:49:33,880
right that I'm wrong and they find excuses
they find proofs that's called deviancy it's

809
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:40,599
called confusion it's called perversions

810
01:49:40,599 --> 01:49:48,380
it really believes in those things and guess
what their ego is so big that they fabricate

811
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:55,449
plenty of reasons and excuses inside this
sutra and that sutra 50 skandhas demons

812
01:49:55,449 --> 01:50:02,699
and so forth this is what the especially my
master's disciples like to do when I was a

813
01:50:02,699 --> 01:50:09,380
novice over there and they they claim already
among the monks that I was possessed by the

814
01:50:09,380 --> 01:50:17,900
demon therefore decided 50 skandhas demons
say this guy is possessed by a demon

815
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:22,440
okay that's how they get rid of me and try
to get rid of me

816
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:31,139
and because of that such people who tried
those things are actually possessed by the

817
01:50:31,139 --> 01:50:40,849
demons [Laughter] I don't need to do anything
to retaliate they possess by demons by their

818
01:50:40,849 --> 01:51:01,440
own doing what do we care

819
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:07,280
and that's dangerous so to summaries to
summarize for you if you're not enlightened

820
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:17,639
yet and you insist on your ways okay you fall
into this group

821
01:51:17,639 --> 01:51:22,280
you insist that you are right

822
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:32,869
and it cannot be explained to you because
you are, remember? stupid. you don't understand

823
01:51:32,869 --> 01:51:39,929
you don't realize your deviant beliefs you're
confused you have perversions you don't even

824
01:51:39,929 --> 01:51:43,050
realize it

825
01:51:43,050 --> 01:51:50,179
go ahead Wei Mountain thank you master um does
depression increase your ego increase your

826
01:51:50,179 --> 01:51:59,630
ego because since everyone has the ego or
is a different thing yes and no, it depends.

827
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:10,679
but depression is caused by the ghost taking
over and playing this program in your head

828
01:52:10,679 --> 01:52:19,230
it says I feel bad I feel bad I feel bad i
feel bad I don't feel like doing anything

829
01:52:19,230 --> 01:52:25,070
I don't want to do this I don't want to do
that and that's a depression that's a program

830
01:52:25,070 --> 01:52:30,620
like computer program keeps on playing that
same thing whatever it does it ends with I

831
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:34,720
don't want to do this whatever it is I don't
want to do it whatever it is I don't want

832
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:39,130
to get up I don't want to address I don't
want to take a shower I don't want to eat

833
01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:45,820
I don't want to sleep whatever okay I don't
want to I don't want to that's depression

834
01:52:45,820 --> 01:52:57,020
because I don't want to means I want to continue
to feel this bad

835
01:52:57,020 --> 01:53:04,530
but I want to continue to feel this bad is
not even detected by depressed people they're

836
01:53:04,530 --> 01:53:16,579
not aware of it that's why they need help

837
01:53:16,579 --> 01:53:17,579
yes

838
01:53:17,579 --> 01:53:25,060
master that's why I was saying there's some
attachment that's what you were saying about

839
01:53:25,060 --> 01:53:31,790
i don't want to stop feeling better no no
it's the program that's loaded onto

840
01:53:31,790 --> 01:53:34,679
by the ghost in your brains it's not you

841
01:53:34,679 --> 01:53:45,869
it could be as simple as get the heck out
of there and the ghost is gone if you do that

842
01:53:45,869 --> 01:53:57,329
though there is a problem where does it go most
likely your mother you want that

843
01:53:57,329 --> 01:54:01,350
that's why it's delicate you cannot brute
force it youtube

844
01:54:01,350 --> 01:54:07,280
from Vicky master how do we check ourselves
to see our false thoughts and thoughts of

845
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:18,889
this disagreements you can this is why

846
01:54:18,889 --> 01:54:25,369
remember you are stupid there's no way to
explain to you I don't know how else to put

847
01:54:25,369 --> 01:54:29,590
it

848
01:54:29,590 --> 01:54:35,840
explain to you you don't get it that's called
stupidity it's stupidity because no matter

849
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:45,409
how hard we try you don't get it because you're
stupid okay if you're stupid already stupid

850
01:54:45,409 --> 01:54:58,850
people think they know more than a good knowing
advisor then it's time for them to leave

851
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:15,810
people who are stupid don't deserve to stay

852
01:55:15,810 --> 01:55:20,989
Wei Mountain

853
01:55:20,989 --> 01:55:30,270
master, does our Wei Mountain Daniel have a
depressing ghost? if it does, what is this depressing

854
01:55:30,270 --> 01:55:35,510
ghost doing to Daniel or what Daniel is doing
reflecting that presence?

855
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:47,889
I don't know it's a Catholic thing we're Buddhists
why do we need to worry about the Catholic

856
01:55:47,889 --> 01:55:48,889
stuff

857
01:55:48,889 --> 01:55:57,869
there's a problem and you know you know you
I know I know you think I'm joking but here's

858
01:55:57,869 --> 01:56:01,960
what happens to me

859
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:10,389
you come to me and you say master I'm depressed
I need help I say okay do this he said but

860
01:56:10,389 --> 01:56:19,909
can I do something else don't like it can
I do something else

861
01:56:19,909 --> 01:56:24,810
and that's a problem with you

862
01:56:24,810 --> 01:56:27,119
if

863
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:33,820
I try to help you and tell you to do something
and you don't why should I continue to help

864
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:37,550
you

865
01:56:37,550 --> 01:56:43,780
you're helpless you need my help you ask for
my help I try to help you and you say oh can

866
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:47,599
you give me something else I like

867
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:54,250
if I give you something you like that is not
true help the help usually is to do something

868
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:56,040
that you don't like

869
01:56:56,040 --> 01:57:16,300
so Daniel's problem is that to be blunt
with you that was probably that yes I like

870
01:57:16,300 --> 01:57:21,460
this I like this about this guy I like this
about this temple I like the fact they respect

871
01:57:21,460 --> 01:57:27,199
me I like the fact they never pressure me
I like the fact they uh joke with me around

872
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:32,540
and so forth uh but I don't like this I don't
like that I don't believe this I don't believe

873
01:57:32,540 --> 01:57:36,960
that so you it's like you you pick from a
menu I like this I like that I like this I

874
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:42,400
like that and that's not how we cultivate
the cultivation is you need to take things

875
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:52,480
that both you like and the ones you don't
like you have no choices if you pick and choose

876
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:56,929
you won't make it

877
01:57:56,929 --> 01:58:09,989
that's a difference

878
01:58:09,989 --> 01:58:16,500
so Daniel says oh I really like you know
the things that talk about how great I am

879
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:21,850
I have the same Buddha nature as their Buddhas
and so forth but you know I go back to my

880
01:58:21,850 --> 01:58:32,949
god when I feel uncomfortable and that's his
problem that's where his ghosts hide in the

881
01:58:32,949 --> 01:58:39,810
areas where he disagrees that's why they all
gather they all build their build headquarters

882
01:58:39,810 --> 01:58:47,800
over there so as soon as he's uncomfortable
he retreats back to his let's say Catholic

883
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:55,079
areas Catholic headquarters and that's what
the ghosts are and that's off limits to us

884
01:58:55,079 --> 01:59:06,730
remember we will never try to convert a Catholic
Wei Mountain

885
01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:11,780
thank you master so people who are uh who
are suffering depression uh what would you

886
01:59:11,780 --> 01:59:15,880
give them your first instruction

887
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:18,989
what's the question again

888
01:59:18,989 --> 01:59:24,219
for people who are suffering depression uh
what would be your first uh instruction to

889
01:59:24,219 --> 01:59:33,119
give them how to start it depends on who it
is on their samadhi level on a lot of factors

890
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:40,600
each person is different no one solution for
everything and when you go to a see a therapist

891
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:45,820
they give you what is it prozac or whatever
medicine there is a limited number of medication

892
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:53,679
they will prescribe to you for us we have
unlimited number of tools to use so each person

893
01:59:53,679 --> 02:00:00,760
is different it's not the same thing so each
individual has different dosages different

894
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:08,400
medication uh different approaches depending
on the time of day the time of the year and

895
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:15,949
so forth and so forth there is no hard and fast
rule to deal with depression because each

896
02:00:15,949 --> 02:00:27,219
time each case is different

897
02:00:27,219 --> 02:00:32,329
sometimes we let them just like I gave you
the example of master XianJie I let him suffer for

898
02:00:32,329 --> 02:00:40,079
a while okay sometimes a long long time

899
02:00:40,079 --> 02:00:43,920
and that's part of the treatment

900
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:48,900
because like most Westerners they full of themselves
they think they know they think they understand

901
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:53,480
they think they know everything

902
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:58,420
that's why they need to suffer and they need
to exhaust all the resources until they realize

903
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:03,930
that they're helpless they truly are helpless
then they believe then they listen same thing

904
02:01:03,930 --> 02:01:08,510
in Daniel Daniels hey I have my Catholic I
have my god here I come back to my god when

905
02:01:08,510 --> 02:01:13,710
I'm uncomfortable go back to your god and
ask him to help with your depression and see

906
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:20,940
what happens don't come to me and pick and
choose when I tell you to do something do

907
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:32,340
it you don't do it I will not tell you anymore
I have no time to waste Wei Mountain

908
02:01:32,340 --> 02:01:39,679
thank you master, um I'm feeling depressed
because I you know I lost my job and I'm

909
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:48,469
continuing to look for a job, do you have any
instruction for me?

910
02:01:48,469 --> 02:01:54,860
why you have to feel depressed many people
lost their jobs and they need to look for

911
02:01:54,860 --> 02:02:02,210
a job you don't have to take it personally
it happens

912
02:02:02,210 --> 02:02:07,590
okay that's called being an adult

913
02:02:07,590 --> 02:02:12,329
we find a job we work and we lose it

914
02:02:12,329 --> 02:02:13,960
that's part of professional careers

915
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:19,440
why should you let that make you depressed

916
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:30,159
that's normal people have to look for jobs
constantly and even right now it's difficult

917
02:02:30,159 --> 02:02:36,840
to look for a job so be it keep looking and
that's part of cultivation cultivation is

918
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:43,510
that you keep going no matter how difficult
it is

919
02:02:43,510 --> 02:02:52,679
to feel depressed about the situation is not
necessary of course it's difficult and when

920
02:02:52,679 --> 02:02:58,119
you get after you get a job it's also difficult

more humble okay we all have our moments of

942
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:52,079
weaknesses we all have our vulnerabilities
uh it's okay it's okay to share them don't

943
02:05:52,079 --> 02:06:00,150
be afraid okay you cannot be strong unless
you're vulnerable believe it or not Wei Mountain
