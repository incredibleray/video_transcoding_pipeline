00:10:38 | Hello everyone! Today is the 23rd October 2021. Uh we gathered here to start discussing the sixth patriarch sutra, one of the most important document Buddhist scripture on the sudden teaching okay, which is a distinctive characteristics of the Chan school of Mahayana all right. So the full name is the six patriarchs dharma jewel platform sutra, okay. And on slide let's see we are redoing this because we did this like four years ago, four plus years ago, and when we first started for our for over four years ago, uh we uh my intention was the honor of my late Chinese teacher master XuanHua. And so who was hiding under his shadow and tried to explain to simply try to elaborate what he meant was my intention. And now the condition changed a little bit, so now we try to explain the sutra from the American Mahayana perspective instead of Chinese Mahayana perspectives. So uh that's why we are uh and we i we feel that it's worthwhile to do it again, and explain it in a way for people in the 21st century, especially western educated people. I'm not Chinese, but I try I'm sort of a hybrid person, I try to bridge the gap between the east eastern culture and the western culture. And luckily for us, we have a lot of very competent Chinese-speaking people as well, so and Taiwanese as well, no disrespect intended to the Taiwanese people, so it is a collaborative effort. I hope you all pitch in, and we will each other we learn from each other, and make this a richer and more rewarding experience. In particular, this is a very auspicious, because uh we also have the Korean audience as well. Korean is a culture a Buddhist culture that emphasizes Chan meditation, in particular the HuaTou, they put a lot of emphasis on that and so this is an in a small way a liberal contribution to their chain culture, and they call seon culture as well okay, so welcome all of you! Thank you very much! Okay god when you get on your knees like, that is it me? Thank you. All right like so uh six uh that's uh jump right into it uh <br/>
00:13:56 | The sixth patriarch is the six patriarch from a Chinese lineage. The first patriarch was Indian, there's a venerable great master Mahākāśyapa, so there is a first patriarch of the orthodox line lineage of orthodox Buddhism. So the very important thing here we need to take away from this is that, this is uh where, if you want to learn Buddhism, if you want to learn Mahayana, this is where you should go and look for good teachers, these patriarchs all right. So it started in India, and then eventually it was transferred from India to China and to via venerable great master Bodhidharma, and the 28th patriarch okay <br/>
00:14:49 | Is there a question on JMT, or just my imagination? Because the sign keeps on flashing, that you know, or is it just uh Malcolm who cannot decide uh between uh Seoul and uh and JMT, huh? Anyway, is it you, Malcolm? Yeah, I recognize his flaming hair yeah now today, yesterday is that uh it's in Seoul and today is in at uh jewel mountain temple. Yeah hello, yeah the world traveler! [Laughter]<br/>
00:15:34 | All right, so the venerable great master Bodhidharma brought the Mahayana transferred Mahayana from India to China, because that's at the time, that's where the next competent students would be found. This is a problem with patriarch, they need to go where the students are so that they can teach them and train them, okay. So at that time, venerable Bodhidharma had to go to India from India to China, he abandoned India, his Indian disciples, went cold turkey to China on his own, by himself, no entourage okay. And he went there and to transfer the Indian Mahayana knowledge to the Chinese, uh the first patriarch was, so he became the first Chinese patriarch. So he's like holding two hats: Indian patriarch, 28th patriarch from India, and first Chinese patriarch, all right. So and he transferred it to the uh the second Chinese patriarch by the name of HuiKe, okay. So what did he transfer? They didn't quite say it, but what he transferred is had to be the sudden teaching. Mahayana is about the sudden teaching, if you don't have sudden teaching you cannot teach Mahayana, if you don't understand the sudden teaching you cannot really train the next generation at all, and that's a constraint. And that's why uh when we got to the sixth patriarch, six Chinese patriarch, we're in venerable HuiNeng okay, he was there around the 8th century a.d all right. So now it's light number four<br/>
00:17:50 | In contrast, if you look at the Hinayana hierarchy of Buddhism, then you have to you want to learn Hinayana, then I have tremendous respect for the Thai people, the Thai Buddhist system. Why is that? Because they have a long history of training people. I met some of the recent head monks, Thai monks, and they are very good, they are really uh pretty good levels of arhats, four-stage arhats, and therefore that system consistently passed on that knowledge to the next generation. This is the key to Buddhism, Buddhism is about once you have the knowledge, once you have the wisdom, it is behooves upon you to pass it on to the next generation, you cannot let it discontinue at all. So that knowledge about the sudden teaching in Mahayana must be passed on to the next generation okay, and similarly, in Hinayana they have a way of training people so that they have a tremendous success, they produce a lot of four-stage arhats and probably pratyekabuddha as well, even though I haven't met any yet okay. So that's the distinctive characteristics over there. And uh, so they have a lot of uh Thai uh jargon here, they're they're big shots and uh just between us uh, don't say this don't quote me okay, among them are Bodhisattva, they're gonna be offended, I saw some of them are bodhisattvas okay. You know why it's important? Because the bodhisattvas help defend them against the demonic perversion in the system, because they spot those things and say no, no cut this off, this is why you call the doctor and cut off the limb, this is a bad limb, cut it off, cut it off okay, otherwise the system will be what's the word Master XianJie? Tainted? What else? Um, I'm not sure what we're looking for right now, sorry. Okay, I'll what is the more polite term for polluted? Deteriorate, it is too uh scholar scholarly, is it like corrupted? Corrupted, thank you! It's very serious, if you let corruption sneak in, that's the beginning of the end. Just like speaking of uh governments and policy and so forth you know, we go to another country and try to change government and change the political system and all, and you don't guard against corruption in government, that's it, it will never work. Never ever never happened, never worked in Vietnam, for example, okay, never worked in any country as a matter of fact. If you have corruption in the system will fall, so what happened, never mind about politics, and you know uh so what happened is that, in the Thai system, they have Bodhisattva disguising themselves as arhats, and they are not in power, they only serve in advisory roles. And and and that's why the system is so healthy so strong, because of that reason they have protection. Because if you leave alone it alone to the arhats, the arhats can still be fooled okay, so that's why that's why in terms of Hinayana I highly recommend you want to learn my Hinayana thing go to Thailand, I highly recommend it okay. <br/>
00:22:44 | And they have a council. I know briefly about it, I met the head guy from Thai council, yeah he is a fourth stage arhat for sure, and uh he has spiritual penetrations as well and so forth okay. So these people for real folks, they're worth the worthy of our offerings okay, I would not hesitate to make offerings though okay. Yeah, uh and uh the supreme patriarch is uh this uh great monk here, Rattanakosin.<br/>
00:23:13 | okay uh since 2017 and so forth, look how young he is! yeah young looking he is okay and uh all right. so so that's the buddhism right there if you want you are a believer in hinayana okay, and you say mahayana not for me, go to thailand. i i don't care whoever you are okay, it's a it's a great place to learn. yes sir yellow. be the more proper adjective corrupt? yeah, corrupt, yeah, thank you! thank you very much! all right i stand corrected, i should be more corrupt okay. corrupted is is not quite correct okay all right. so so going back to our small world of mahayana, because in the west right now Master XuanHua transmitted his knowledge of the sudden teaching to this country already okay, meaning that the fact from a fresh from a professional perspective, the people here are better recipients of that teaching then the people back in his country, as a fact okay, no disrespect intended for the taiwanese either all right. so so he had to go to this country to the US to transfer the sudden teaching dharma door okay, so as americans here, american has no color skin color by the way, as you can look around, you only hardly any white-color skins here at all you see, and that's a nature of american buddhism. american buddhism people think american american is like you know, it's must be caucasian, no! american is a mixed you know thing, and and and uh and that's what makes america superior in my in in my in my mind, is that the ability to absorb and embrace everything, that is the spirit mahayana right there okay. <br/>
00:25:46 | So he had to go to this country, master XuanHua okay, brought this Chinese Mahayana to the US. in particular, he brought the dharma door of the sudden teaching okay. Sudden teaching meaning that, those of you who are not familiar with this sudden teaching, meaning that with this teaching meaning you have to hear it you have to, someone has to speak it okay. And with when you hear this, when you read this, you can attain enlightenment suddenly okay. Only in Mahayana can you have that okay, and so this uh the six patriarch taught this uh method of sudden enlightenment if you will okay, and uh and so uh this dharma door here actually has many access routes, it leads to that door called certain enlightenment. But to get there has many pathways, if you will, all right. Questions? This is very important, this is a momentous moment in China when my great master Bodhidharma went to China and decided ah I'm gonna teach HuiKe, great master HuiKe, this sudden teaching thing. And then master HuiKe then transferred it to the third patriarch, who transferred the fourth patriarch, who transferred it to the fifth patriarch, master HongRen, who then transferred that sudden teaching to master HuiNeng, and we'll find out a little bit later all right. So this is very important, and by the way, okay as Americans okay the mindset should be that we should be grateful to the Chinese for this gift, because you know it's a gift that will have tremendous consequences for us, our generation as well our children's generation, and further, further down the road as well okay. This is a very critical heritage that we are leaving behind, okay. So that's why we uh since master XuanHua didn't really elaborate that much about the sudden teaching when he taught this in how long ago, I don't remember anyone knows he taught this, he explained the sutra, explained the six patriarch sutra is one of the popular explanations out there. For in Mahayana a lot of people, Buddhists and non-Buddhists like would read up on his books, they find it very, very interesting, very insightful. And, but he never really elaborated that much on the sudden teaching, which is what venerable HuiNeng specialized in doing okay. So we'll dwell more on that side. <br/>
00:29:07 | Right number eight, uh and at the time at the time Buddhism uh was there in China already okay, but just like nowadays just like typically what happens that, that people studied books studied scriptures and did ceremonies, and so what it's called very superficial cultivation okay. Substance is what Mahayana is about okay, it's about uh the core, your core your heart, it's not it's not about appearances, not about temples, it's not about fame reputation all right. <br/>
00:30:27 | Go ahead, Korea JMT. Good morning from Korea! Good morning, um good afternoon to you too. Good morning there, and good afternoon here [Laughter]. Master, did Bodhidharma walk from walk all the way on foot from India to China? [Music] not true! It's uh it's a myth what actually happened, it sounded good but what should happen is the Chinese would like you to believe that he walked, but it's not true. Actually, what happened is he boarded a boat, he didn't swim either, and then he walked to Vietnam, that's true yeah. Monks couldn't uh couldn't ride horses, they can't, they can't ride horses, only for pets but not for riding, uh that's how they keep horses. Yes go ahead uh flaming hair. Uh master this is more of a comment, there's a there's a rapper I listened to, and he wrote a book, and Bodhidharma was mentioned, and he's he was that's where I got that from, he walked from India to China. And um he actually mentioned Chan in the book and then that zen came from Chan like the Javanese zen, so I thought that was pretty cool that he they. Um, this is kind of a rap song? So it's a rapper that got me into the um, the Asian culture a long time ago. Yeah, I hear right, you listen to rap. Not as much anymore. Good for you! [Laughter] I'm open-minded, but there are certain things I just can't stand, just kidding. All right very good <br/>
00:32:38 | Yes, Wei mountain. Oh god, I always get in trouble when I joke too much. Master, where did Bodhidharma go to Vietnam? In Vietnam, oh my my my province Huế definitely. Central Vietnam, no hesitation, no doubt. <br/>
00:32:59 | yes uh over here black. so it is the tradition story that bodhidharma came to china, um well actually while he was trying in china he traveled well. no sorry i think when he came to china he um can buy a piece of leaf and then no went across the water right? no no no no no no no. you chinese, a nice try. no no no no no no, you're distorting the fact, you're china's china person, no no. you can't, you you can't sneak that in, no no no no no. i think uh uh he boarded a boat, i think a viking boat yeah. um it was it was coded as an example of um you actually can show um spiritual power as a chan master to teach people. when he was in china he did cross a river on a leaf. oh yeah. see your chinese history is so mixed. i saw the indian ocean i guess indian ocean is an ocean it's not a river. yeah yeah okay get your chinese facts straight please. all right yeah he did cross, actually that's very famous yeah there's there's plenty of uh uh drawings of him on a leaf yeah. oh i think uh that's when uh they showed up like, yeah that's chinese. he uh he came from the north when after he talked with Emperor Wu of Liang and then he pissed off the Emperor Wu of Liang and then he left the northern china to go to southern china, i think that's where the the story of the one leaf crossed the river yeah. he crossed a river and on on a leaf that's true okay yeah, and and uh not clear on how what propelled him okay all right, but it's true that he did cross water on a leaf, that's pretty impressive okay. uh and uh and so so he was actually pretty desperate looking for someone, so anyone please who wants to learn mahayana i know from me, take it off my hands okay. the chinese: no no, you're too black, i mean your skin too dark, we don't trust you. so you know so he really struggled and finally he found a yellow soul, i mean a chinese soul who took it from him okay. and we're grateful for that, my point here is that in all due respect okay, i personally i'm grateful to chinese culture, i feel it's because because the when when great master bodhidharma transferred the mahayana to china, he he really the chinese buddhism that i learned, mahayana buddhism i learned is tremendous, so profound, it's so beautiful so wonderful and it's a gift to the world really. you should transcend the national barriers and and races and genders and so forth, because this buddhism here is to me it's beauty, it's just like you look at a piece of art, it's to me it's like that. you look at a statue Rodin or or what's a guy who lost his ear cut his ear to give to a prostitute girlfriend? van gogh okay. those things are just beautiful, i mean look at this like wow yeah you know, it it makes you feel good in your heart you know, it's not the visual thing you look at, that yeah i mean it connects from that painting to your heart directly okay, through the stomach. but um yeah but so so i'm grateful, i don't know about you, i'm so grateful that the chinese buddhism because what we got from them, what i got from Master XuanHua is it's it's so beautiful. the first time my life after i learned mahayana i said: wow! this is wonderfully beautiful okay. mahayana is helps you appreciate beauty okay. <br/>
00:37:38 | yes was there a question somewhere? master, what is the meaning behind venerable bodhidharma leaving on the leaf? because this has been thousands of years and there's a lot of painting about it. meeting him what leaving across the cross the river by one piece of one leaf, i have no idea okay, when i'm able to do that i will explain it to you. and don't hold your breath okay. uh you you vietnamese people weird you know, i'm just talking about the depth and the beauty of mahayana he says let's go back to floating on a leaf across the river, what's beautiful about that? to me is it's a it's indian show-off okay. i'm we're talking about beautiful chinese people, chinese things okay and taiwanese too yeah, it's so difficult nowadays you know to not offend one and and and please the other. <br/>
00:38:51 | uh anyway so anyway so this sutra here uh it's about it's about uh the emphasis of this sutra here is actually uh about cultivation in order to learn about the sudden teaching here you need to grind it out first you need to bear the discomfort and and keep grinding and grinding and when you ready that's when the sudden teaching is bestowed upon you and boom you leap okay any questions okay and and and uh this is a function the sudden teaching is a function of the responsibility of the great teachers and and in a way to be fair uh master XuanHua did transmit the sudden teaching to his disciples but low level sudden teaching all right and you pay attention to how he explained the six patriarch suture you find that yes there's some some illusions to a sudden teaching and when master XuanHua explained it but he didn't really go into greater depths so hopefully we add more to it this is important because remember okay what we what i call american mahayana is hardly by the skin color okay look at us the asians are taking over silicon valley let's face it [Laughter] all right okay on the koreans they have no sense of humor and this is there ah these poor koreans a long way to go all right so jewel jewel is his dharma that is precious and jewel is uh is when you hear<br/>
00:40:43 | jewel or gem that's a great value it's highly desirable and it's so chinese to me to me i would prefer first americans to look at the beauty of the dharma the dharma is beautiful the dharma i assure you if you understand the dharma you see the beauty what kind of beauty uh estee lauder lancome no beauty of people's heart the heart you cut it up can be very beautiful when you look at it not with the knife okay people's heart when you get to recognize you get to see them people's heart is so beautiful and i yesterday i was playing with a kid a kid naughty naughty kid okay and i it's amazing i tell you this you know i was playing the kid and i was teaching at the same time i was teaching the kid about emotions and yesterday he was playing and he tripped he fell on his butt the right butt so he was he was gathering himself up and touching his butt and was deciding should i cry now or or what i'm entitled cry am i not and he was as he was thinking i laughed at him i made fun of him and he immediately got the message and said i'm so this is so embarrassing how could i fall like this he hit behind he ran away and hit immediately okay so so kids heart can be so beautiful too you know anyway so the jewel here to me it's not it's not the gem like a chinese people would like the asians like to think you know the indians are into gold chinese are into jade okay girls are into diamonds i heard and i'm into vajra okay vajra is beautiful okay and and and but but primarily you know the is the heart that interests me about this mahayana here and the heart here is is uh uh the heart of mahayana the heart of master HuiNeng in particular is precious it's rare and to me it's sublime all right<br/>
00:43:49 | platform apparently on slide number 10 platform is where the place where the sutra is spoken is NanHua okay in that famous temple there and they build a platform like here uh about 10 feet uh Wontek Sunim how tall is this when you build this you remember how tall is this not even 31 inches okay and uh and the platform is a is a place a revere place pure place where they did important things in buddhism they transmit the precept substance from the heart from master to your heart that's what it happens and then they speak the dharma to shape the heart okay and that's called buddhist plastic surgery all right seriously they they knew about plastic surgery back then already uh all right 11.<br/>
00:44:59 | sutra is anything that's spoken by the buddha to teach us about cultivation and and and sutra here has a meaning like to attract it's a it's a it's the logic the uh beauty of the teaching you know the uh the superior intellect the superior wisdom is very attractive to most of us and it's a and and it's designed to give us directions on how to what? the chinese like to say to cultivate i don't think of cultivation i'm thinking sutra is teaching us how to live our lives to the fullest whether you're a left home person or a lay person okay sutras are supposed to do that supposed to teach us how to live okay be happier our lives okay and when you're happy okay you share it with your family you share it with your students you share your co-workers okay and uh in particular this way of practice here is in accord or consistent with the intent of the buddhas and the wisdom of the buddhas all right so this sutra here is very special because because it is um it is the first time in chinese buddhism and i don't know it happened in indian buddhism or not but in chinese buddhism buddhism is the only time that the sutra was uh recorded and the teaching was recorded and classified as a sutra when it was spoken by a chinese monk not the buddha okay so it's very very special it's really a a a treasure to the chinese okay so we should be grateful here in our era us here in this country that we're able to receive this as a gift from the chinese okay you need to give credit where it's do so we need to be good to be grateful to the chinese uh kindness and generosity via master XuanHua okay all right at least i am grateful i don't know about you okay so when he is explaining sutras we go through the TianTai school for general analysis to give us an overview what to expect from the sutra so explain the names uh and and uh according to that the TianTai school the sutra is by the title it refers to a person and a dharma analogy and a place and so forth uh blah blah blah you know you can you can look it up i'm i'm not interested in these things uh it's too TianTai for me and discriminating is the substance uh it's talked about real mark as substance and the real mark here is a very advanced concept for enlightened people and this is the distinctive characteristics for chinese buddhism okay real mark is is by definition real mark is no mark but uh but nothing is without mark okay 實相無相無不相 is the chinese thing i memorized couldn't understand it 25 years ago okay that's all you have to do memorize it no mark but nothing without mark that is real mark all right yes yellow master just a quick question is it possible that the sixth<br/>
00:49:18 | patriarch is a reincarnation of shakyamuni buddha no he's vietnamese i'm glad you asked we hear this a lot you know my late vietnamese master said you know i have proof i written a book on how the six patriarch is vietnamese i say oh i know you want to live in your temple so i'm not going to disagree with you [Laughter] uh it's so easy reincarnation in the buddha my in my humble opinion i feel he's a buddha okay because his depth he's my teacher is chinese and he's he's his level is very very high okay but when you look at his teachings the way he taught his disciples see i'm he knew and he taught me three times directly in person and the other time is like i hear you know i go crazy like flaming hair ah yeah there we go again we wouldn't believe it yesterday i was talk that taught me about five six different emotions he became just like that oh no now he has a companion all right so uh so easy is he a buddha i feel that he's a buddha because the teaching is so profound so so beautiful you will okay but i don't think he is shakyamuni buddha at all okay uh because that would be a bad president and the buddha came he left and he came back again say what he has nothing else to do i mean it's like if you leave please go don't don't come back to me it's just like doesn't make sense there's no point being so sticky and the buddha come and go and and let the next buddha come give them a chance you know so you know you guys are too sticky no no i i hope it's not shakyamuni buddha but i don't know because you asked me about state of buddha wrong person to ask okay ask something i know not something i don't know okay what is the principle here okay uh to become a buddha all of us can become a buddha okay message don't sell yourself short no discrimination okay so that's uh uh it's it's uh anyone can become a buddha that's why no that's why that's why now is our chance okay we don't have to go to china anymore although you know you want to learn tai chi i still feel we need still need to go to china wudang okay i will go to wudang for about a year too i would love to go there and learn you know i hear speaking of walking on leaves i hear they walk on walls i saw a demonstration he actually walked on walls i was so impressed i said wow anyway yeah so you can realize realize buddhahood you can all of us can okay no one is exempt even the lady back there who's half asleep she can too the sudden teaching is that we can all become a buddha just like that that she must have to cross her legs just kidding it's a requirement you think it's free you know we have to work for it and the function is to understand the mind and see your own nature here understanding the mind is very interesting you get to see how mind works your mind how your mind works and once you understand how your mind works you begin to be able to see how Yin's minds work you see all right and the teaching mark is uh oh god it's so scholarly sutra like sweet do heavenly elixir immortality yeah so chinese i don't like these concepts because it makes you greedy you know it's like makes you so special i'm i'm listening to six patriarch sutra hello mama from china [Laughter] i'm glad you made it the last time i saw you in wei mountain temple [Music] so so this uh this uh not only is beautiful but it's very tasty you can taste you know that has to be real when you listen the sutra and so every now and then you might get to the state where actually when you swallow your saliva it's kind of sweet that's a sweet dew right there it happens all right and and teaching period is uh is uh uh this uh happened during the flower uh dharma flower or Lotus-Nirvana period and then so forth okay all right any questions i'm not as you have noticed by now i'm not interested in scholarly thing i'm just like this raw and uh and uh limited person i'm more interested in something that that uh that's a beautiful tasty and that kind of thing you will have my interest but scholarly things i leave it to the phd people all right um five chinese patriarchs okay now you should uh be you should know<br/>
00:56:17 | about okay that's how uh chinese buddhism uh started to take root in china this is important because we need to know for our generation how are we going to make these american mahayana take root okay we are right now i'm my second generation you're a third generation so therefore it helps to go back to how it happened in china okay because we learned from a chinese anyway and so it's uh it's set from the uh song of enlightment another famous chinese uh creation by the seventh patriarch that he recognized bodhidharma was a 28th patriarch okay in that proper or orthodox line of mahayana buddhism okay and and all the indian prior patriarchs from 1 to 27 followed bodhidharmas to he brought all that indian heritage from india to china and conferred upon the chinese so the chinese inherited all the indian wisdom okay and that's what is meant by transmitting the wisdom from india to china okay it became chinese the chinese became the guardian of the indian wisdom and and and later on after six patriarch the chinese buddhism later on really really prospered and blossomed they produce many great talents many great patriarchs that i feel that for us in our era our times we should spend the time to learn chinese and study these great chinese teachers because the depth of mahayana i keep on telling you this is in the chinese language not in english yet okay so if you want mahayana wisdom deeper wisdom higher level wisdom you have to learn chinese okay any questions about that so you know where to find look for materials and where to look where to look for in terms of great teachers it's not you know the uh the chinese teachings patriarch teachings actually much higher level than here that's available in english that's a fact okay so for you those of you out there who feel that you understand mahayana i strongly urge you to learn chinese because you should go back to the chinese teachers okay and in the future i hope you transfer translate that teaching from chinese into english okay in order to do that you have to learn chan chan is a requirement okay without chan you cannot have the proper translation and you find in the sutra that we use an old version of my master's disciples translation and it has quite a few things that missed the mark completely okay and so there are there are some significant<br/>
01:00:03 | patriarchs Mahākāśyapa don't have much teaching of him Ananda and then the second patriarch fourteen patriarch very famous they were Nagarjuna Nagarjuna how how do you say it have flaming hair wow master i don't know but um not what naga una [Music] okay and and then an uh Nagarjuna and then uh Vasubandu is another famous uh uh famous indian patriarch next 15. uh bodhidharma we're talking about bodhidharma he is a prince in<br/>
01:01:04 | of a kingdom in southern india king is very devout buddhist it shows right there if your parents are buddhists then you're bestowing great blessings to your children because you give them exposure to the teaching of wisdom okay so so the conventional wisdom is that is that when you're born into a family as buddhist you are incredibly blessed if you will all uh of course there're always exceptions but not only was uh the king was a buddhist he is a devout buddhist and and he made uh offerings to the patriarch so he have access to the 27th patriarch okay and he gave a priceless pearl to patriarch okay lesson number two you have to make offerings to the patriarchs to the great teachers okay so this king here not only was he devout devoted to buddhism meaning he helped propagate buddhism he also made a lot of offerings supported the great teachers the patriarchs okay and because of that his children have tremendous blessings okay and so this is very special family so when he offered priceless pearl to the 27th indian patriarch he showed the pearl the patriarch showed the pearl to the three princes son of the king and asked anything more valuable in this pearl that i just received and the the two older princes said uh pearl is the most precious in our kingdom and there's nothing better in the world i'm very proud of it 16. the third prince the youngest one was bodhidharma<br/>
01:03:46 | which later became bodhidharma said this was worldly pearl is not the most precious thing it is among all the gems in the world the truth is the supreme jewel okay so indian okay but but back then as a young prince he had he valued the truth already okay he felt the truth was a treasure that that that you that should be cherished not not gems and jewels okay and the prince continues he says this this worldly luster cannot be considered the finest okay the light the the brightness the light that's most precious is uh from the light of wisdom and uh the pearl even though uh has uh lucidity but the lucidity of the mind is is the most desirable okay so uh the young prince uh answer is uh is uh really outstanding and so so the it showed that this this young man here had potential to be taught okay and that's what great teachers recognize they recognize people say who can be taught who would be worthy of my efforts yes go ahead yellow master regarding the pronunciation of Nagarjuna anthony heard from a disciple<br/>
01:05:55 | it's pronounced Nagarjuna that's what i heard from one of your disciples i think yeah yeah i remember vaguely i just cannot remember which uh which syllable to put the inflection on so i thought it was from flaming hair but it's not it's from someone else yeah i think it's from someone else yeah yeah someone else it's clearly not flaming hair flaming hair is still uh all right um and uh uh and uh and uh bodhidharma said a lot of things that you know indians<br/>
01:06:32 | they they're wordy and they they talk too much you know from a child perspective if i were the 27th patriarch which i'm not i said you talk too much boy uh uh so anyway it it clearly this this young prince here is a has a special mind he's not impressed by worldly things okay and it comes with it comes with prior blessings if you will if your children have blessings they be drawn to thing of wisdom okay instead of they will not be impressed by the size of the temple if i could influence you a little bit we're not like uh the kings who has palaces and three princes and so forth you know and and so forth what we have is big hearts okay so uh not i'm not interested in what the young bodhidharma had to say to his teacher he's not enlightened back then so it's a lot of nonsense okay but somehow the indians were impressed the chinese were impressed so they they they put this down okay uh to me it's too wordy it's too many words okay it's not chan like and later he became better okay<br/>
01:08:27 | so after the king father's death the young prince became disciple and uh and and became a monk okay so you see uh that's right there again the behavior this person is similar to the buddhas gautama buddhas where he uh he was not uh impressed by worldly things by luxury by the uh the uh worldly pleasures okay he he he followed his teacher and he served his teacher for 40 years until he died okay another another another fact about great bodhidharma is that he serves his teacher okay and and and that's one of the most beautiful things you can do to show gratitude okay he showed the reason he's a prince remember he he's used to being treated like the potential future king future emperor therefore he's supposed to be uh idolized and so forth but no he revered his teacher and became among to serve him for 40 years that's very very impressive okay and to me there is no higher way better way to express gratitude by taking care of your teacher okay i'm a a great teacher like him and and and that's one thing there that you can learn to spot children or people okay okay the common denominator of these great people is that they know gratitude it comes from the heart your heart is big you your heart is full of gratitude you don't always have to take okay you can give okay you give back to the people that did you great favors like your teacher like your parents like your ancestors and so forth okay that's what uh what uh what's special about the asian culture okay you teach gratitude by being grateful not not by talking about it okay and so boddidharma served his master for 40 years that's very impressive okay until his master died and and his master asked him to go to china to uh bring mahayana from india to china so basically named him as a 28th patriarch okay and when he came there didn't speak chinese at all so the chinese were very discriminatory and look at him and say your skin is too black and you two your beard you have a huge beard and you uh so they look down upon this scornful towards uh venerable bodhidharma okay uh don't<br/>
01:12:26 | know why the chinese would draw bodhidharma bare chested with a lot of hair do indians have a lot of hair or not chest hair they do i never know that watch the movies [Laughter] no we're not watching the same movies is there a lot of dancing like i know you you they're talking all sudden the man breaks down to dance and singing anyway hairy chest why why you would draw him like that anyway and then 21 he met with emperor the emperor<br/>
01:13:24 | of the liang dynasty emperor wu this is a very famous interchange okay hey it's funny how children so many children here today who are listening about these words of wisdom and have no clue what we're talking about [Laughter] it's fantastic it's called brainwashing you know that it's called buddhist brain washing you bring us here we put on you you can do the same thing at home by the way turn on the the tapes and and let them you let them play while they listen to all this thing we we talk about it's called brainwashing in the future we come they become you know uh a monk and uh with uh uh patriarch as well so emperor wu who is uh who prided himself on being knowledge about buddhism he spoke to him he said through an interpreter of course and who is that interpreter is probably in my humble opinion in my opinion she's that interpret probably an ancestor our our uh precious Zhihong or you don't know Zhihong it doesn't matter okay so emperor wu says uh in my entire life i help a lot of monks and nuns become monks and nuns because when you become monk or nun you need to have clothing proper clothing so he paid for the clothing for the bowls for the shoes and so forth okay and he built monasteries for them so they say i've done all those and have a lot of sutras copied okay and created a lot of buddha images okay and how how much merit did i earn okay Bodhidharma says none and it says good deeds done with with with greed worldly intent okay i would translate it as greed okay he did all those to impress people okay when you do good deeds to impress others it's it's called worldly intent is self-serving in other words okay and so you're greedy for recognition in other words you greedy for rewards okay that's the wrong way to do good deeds you should do good deeds because because there's a chance to do it that's all when we have the chance to do something good just do it and then forget it okay uh that's all and and uh so bodhidharma said you did a good deed but you bring good karma but no merit okay and the emperor<br/>
01:16:42 | then pursued he says what is the highest meaning so he he he didn't like it so he changed the topic you see emperor's most convenient actually after he heard the first answer it says no merit whatsoever he says you just lost an ear boy i mean indian guy so he said okay but i'm going to be civil he's a patriarch supposedly so i can be i'm an emperor so i need to show my civil side so he said he changed the subject i said what is what he said what is the highest meaning of the noble truth okay see it's very well read bodhidharma says there's no there's no no noble truth there's only emptiness okay Bodhidharma by then was a little bit cautious because he could tell that the emperor was not happy with him and there's no point in offending him and more than he needs to he needed to so he said there's no noble truth there's only emptiness actually he could have said from a chan perspective what is the highest meaning or noble truth he could have said nothing but no he said there's no noble truth there's only emptiness so you can tell he's scared 23 and then the emperor again was stumped he said i can't<br/>
01:18:13 | pursue this so let's give him another one last chance who's standing before me okay meaning 朕 朕 is chinese for i'm better than you you see he says i'm better than you i'm i'm nobility and you are black um dark skinned i mean and the bodhidharma says i know not your majesty okay i know not the proper translation should be changed to i cannot tell Master XianJie don't just sit there do something i cannot tell you see the the immediate answer is so beautiful he says uh i said it says who's in front of me can you try change it please who's in front of me okay who's facing me either one okay and so the brutal answer from from bodhidharma he meant in english is i can't tell all right so after that the emperor gave up and uh he said uh excuse me i need to go take this phone call here from russia<br/>
01:20:41 | and so later he had an advisor would you believe it's ZhiGong ZhiGong is one of the of the wisest chinese monks and what does he do advising this kind of emperor oh my goodness i when i got to this point here i lost all respect for ZhiGong because if you hang around this person he was thirsty for power recognition agreed he was so greedy okay the only way that you can help is yourself because that's how he sees you okay if ZhiGong is a true patriarch a great the person wisdom is that i'm sorry your master okay i'm not worthy of your patronage here's uh the master at the DRBA go go there okay yeah so uh i i it's a personal thing for me because i know i was growing up i mean when i was learning the way uh master XuanHua spoke so highly of master ZhiGong he had spiritual powers and so forth when he got to this point here i said what are you doing advising this emperor so he's this way because you advise him so he's your creation he's a product of your training right so i would run uh okay that's why ZhiGong is you know out uh so ZhiGong says your highness still don't recognize this person so you don't recognize this person okay and the emperor says uh i don't and ZhiGong says this is GuanYin transmitting a buddha's mind seal okay so ZhiGong says bodhidharma actually is guan yin so clearly GuanYin has nothing else to do but we we have so many bodhisattvas and GuanYin says let me bring mahayana from india to china you the rest you can go on vacation go to the bahamas or you take a hike you know something let me do it for you so the rest of bodhisattvas so we don't get a chance to create blessings for ourselves okay so i don't know about this ZhiGong guy here okay yeah it all due respect to the chinese and taiwanese people<br/>
01:23:42 | and um and so the the emperor heard that this is a sage so he was he he uh he had second thoughts and tried to uh send his uh uh his boy to ask the venerable bodhidharma to backtrack and come back so that he can make offerings and support him and and ZhiGong says no don't bother uh uh even if uh uh uh even if the entire nation goes all our people go okay he uh still wouldn't come back okay so he says [CHinese] and she says even if we all go okay he still would not will not come back not return would come back all right and so this is a story of a transmission from india mahayana from India to china so when venerable Bodhidharama<br/>
01:25:04 | went to nanjing listen speak dharma and back then is typical as difficult as it is nowadays people speak dharma without wisdom they spoke words they didn't they didn't teach from the wisdom but from regurgitating the the the technical jargon but even doing even for just doing so the heavens the rain fragrant blossoms and golden petals lotus rose from earth okay and so he's uh he's a extraordinary dharma master to the point where the heavens were making offerings to him and so bodhidharma stopped by listened to his lecture and waited for everyone to leave and cornered dharma master of ShenGuang and asked him what what are you doing ShenGuang says i am explaining sutras can't you tell and i said why are you explaining the sutras he said the answer is uh to teach people to<br/>
01:26:20 | end birth and death and bodhidharma says how does it happen okay the words are black and white how does black and white you know things can end birth and death and ShenGuang couldn't have an answer and this is a lesson i learned do not offend the chinese patriarchs the the<br/>
01:26:47 | chinese the chinese dharma masters okay it's okay for you to offend me because i'm not chinese but but this is a common protocol in that you don't you don't ask questions that that dharma masters cannot answer okay please and uh but ShenGuang is a little bit have a little bit of temp uh temper he got very upset and he whipped out his beads uh made of steels okay and whacked them he says these are the words of the demons and broke the two front tooth so bodhidharma has a new nickname leon [?] yeah so uh you know so whack him and say you are the demon how dare you embarrass me how you say demon's work you're doing demons yeah and and so he broke his teeth because bodhidharma didn't dodge at all i remember and to this point i remember that video of president bush the small one when he went to afghanistan someone threw a shoe at him he went like this he knocked and he ducked in a funny way too but bodhidharma is like a true indian patriarch stood there and lost two teeth i hope he gets good dentist can you imagine we speak dharma and then as we smile and the front of our mouth is black oh yeah yeah what was he thinking i would have ducked myself like little bush and uh Bodhidharma apparently according to<br/>
01:29:11 | chinese the chinese wisdom he says there's a legend where it sage's tooth fall to the earth it would not rain for three years that's probably what happened here in california and so bodhidharma says that would harm a lot of people so i better take the pain and suffering instead of letting bad things happen to the chinese people although they deserve it so uh so the tooth fell out and so he swallowed it okay and then he went away okay and then and then uh according to master XuanHua yes did you have a comment black white red that video person audio person he sees like in a trance yeah right yeah so my question is by swallowing the teeth that it solves the problem so it will rain for three years or it solved that problem or no it wouldn't rain for three years for that the the dragon's intervention but uh at least there won't be a a drought for three years because it would if if he let the tooth the teeth fell fall to the ground they would have a drought for three years there would be no drought for next because of that okay so uh so uh  he swallowed them and disappeared okay and and uh and and uh so according to Master XuanHua i remember this part master XuanHua then said uh immediately right after that and you know please take a grain of salt you know he's not here so we don't know if i i there's lots of things folks i wish i were there because i have so many questions uh i'm not like a typical american who are you know very afraid of master XuanHua i would ask him uh great master really i mean i hit the thing and all of a sudden the venerable ShenGuang was supposed to die right away do you buy that or not i find it's too much a coincidence what's the rationale for that you believe or not when i read that story i said seriously you hit someone and broke two tooth i mean leon spins never you know killed anyone because of that no one died because of that but there is a point to this story why did he die immediately because he inflicted harm on a great great sage supposedly GuanYin according to ZhiGong which i respectfully disagree okay GuanYin would never fight with the bodhisattvas would not compete for for blessings from bodhisattvas i assure you okay we have so many great bodhisattvas who are waiting for craving to bring mayana from india to china why would GuanYin bodhisattva steal those very virtues from them think about it it just didn't make sense to me okay anyway so what happened is this monk here this uh this uh this uh this monk here ShenGuang okay injured a great sage for that mere factor he supposed to fall to the avicii hell the worst hells there is just for that that's how serious it is okay and therefore it's perfectly reasonable to say that he's supposed to die right away because you know how how big of a name bodhidharma was then he deserves to die immediately because it's very serious offense so so he's supposed to die so two ghosts came and said our boss king yama would like to have a word with you which is the you know the the underworld uh word for okay it's time for you to go okay and bodhidharma said uh no the ShenGuang says why i'm so young in a prime of my life you know can i have some more time he said nope your time is up just like that i say yep so so ShenGuang says what did i do what did i do and he said you don't know you broke the two front teeth of a great sage that's why and so ShenGuang says oh i didn't know if i knew i would have not done it the ghost says not my problem okay let's go and uh and ShenGuang got on his knees i think and then begged to the ghost says look at me i'm the dharma master you're the ghost i'm beg to you give me some time so that i uh learned from this monk a little bit so that my life would not have been in vain okay and and so the ghosts must be high-ranking ghosts it says okay i'm not seeing that you are sincere i allow you a little bit of time go and look for that monk and and uh and uh do you think we'll wait a little bit for you and so ShenGuang ran after after bodhidharma by that time okay bodhidharma was walking towards the south yes he went south is it<br/>
01:36:20 | sound no that sixth patriarch you confused so we went somewhere and he passed by a house where they kept there's a bird is kept in a cage a bird cage okay and and the bird recognized bodhidharma and said recognize somehow this bird recognized bodhidharma as a sage so the bird asked him mind from the west mind from west please teach me a way to escape from this cage uh flaming hair<br/>
01:37:14 | can you do it in in a more birdy kind of way try your best word language now very good very good yeah one more time second version unmuted hey korea unmuted i can't hear you master can you hear me okay now now faster go okay mind from the west mind from the west please teach me how to escape from this cage and bodhidharm immediately replied okay let's find a new voice<br/>
01:38:14 | china's chinese person there huh so bodhidharma replied to escape from the cages escape from the cage put out both legs close both eyes this is a way to escape from the cage okay spoke bird language and and and and and that's what the bird did and uh the owner thought the bird oh it was dead so open the cage and try to to uh take the body out but uh the bird flew out okay so that's how the bird escaped okay the great escape if you will great bird escape so anyway the story<br/>
01:39:17 | legend has ShenGuang ran after bodhidharma and went all the way to be a bear's ear mountain in LuoYang and sat down facing a wall that's right behind the future shaolin temple okay and ShenGuang knelt close by behind him apparently for nine years and when i read this i said<br/>
01:39:36 | nine years uh how can you do that for nine years well anyway so he sat for nine years and i'm first question is uh what about bathroom breaks uh and uh and uh so they sat behind uh master bodhidharma for for nine years and bodhidharma ignored him completely didn't talk to him for nine years okay and ShenGuang never gave up it's a test it's a test and and uh test of sincerity okay and one day after nine years ShenGuang never dared bother bodhidharma if you were there and begging for instruction you don't want to nag him you know Qun you hear you don't want to nag okay uh i would not nag okay for something important i would not nag and uh and uh and and one day bodhidharma asked him a question this is very important there's a protocol here you would kneel behind you ask for a favor you ask once and you wait okay you don't nag and then and then so he waited for nine years this is beautiful this is so beautiful of a story to me okay it is so important to you he said how do i end birth and death venerable master teach me how to end birth and death all right you don't text him to death okay you ask once how can I end birth and death and then you kneel down and you wait you can do anything you like you can but you don't nag him anymore the timing is always perfect and and uh so after nine years interestingly uh this is so remarkable about venerable ShenGuang i'm impressed by that that for us in my era waiting for nine years behind him like that is total nonsense the sheer nonsense i don't know about you i cannot do this no way it doesn't make sense to me okay that's why i'm glad that ShenGuang did it for us thank you china and and uh and after nine years uh so it's like it's interestingly like a delay how do i how how do i end birth and death okay and venerable bodhidharma didn't say anything for nine years ignore him completely and the guy would not go away so after nine years and Bodhidharma<br/>
01:43:10 | saying you're still here what's the matter with you i said i'm waiting for the answer i said i will answer you when the snow becomes red and so ShenGuang uh uh got so upset and then he took out a knife and cut his left arm right<br/>
01:43:25 | arm this is what i don't remember his arm right arm okay yeah i am right handed i think i would take my left arm cut my right arm it shows more it's more emphatic so in this movie of mine you take this knife here this probably has not been sharpened yet and you hack away your arm so anyway so it finally cut off and fell to the ground and the snow become red became red so he scooped up some red snow with tainted with blood corrupt with blood and then and then and so great master great master hey this the snow there's red snow the snow has become red and uh now master XuanHua says uh venerable ShenGuang was so upset he had a temper so he cut his arm off to show him uh he's probably right i would never disagree with my my chinese teacher okay yeah ching [Laughter] so so Bodhidharma is impressed<br/>
01:44:52 | and and they say ah and you you are a pretty tough cookie and and and uh and so it is so it is it says wow you're tough so you're tough okay right so it is you're so tough so am i okay you're crazy so am i and he says he says you are worthy to be my student okay so i will teach you i teach you what i know okay and uh so my weight has not been in vain imagine this guy this great teacher has been looking for a descendant for a successor for a long time he saw it in venerable ShenGuang but still put him through the test okay a lot of in buddhism is about enduring the test okay and and that's called what what is that called gradual teaching the tests are gradual teaching you see that that's how mahayana was transmitted from india to china gradually teaching for nine years so he sat there he knelt behind him for nine years so every day he said oh my legs hurt i hurt so much what am i doing here what am i doing here i can't even tell my mother about this she doesn't want me to become a monk in the first place now i had to tell her i'm kneeing behind this dark-skinned monk who cannot speak a single word of chinese and when he decides to teach me how we're gonna what are we gonna use google translate you see he has so many issues there that's unresolved okay and yet he knelt and bodhidharma didn't talk to him he didn't dare ask okay yeah and and uh so part of the teaching is you need to go through hardship because that's part of your gradual training don't expect shortcuts they say tell me the best thing give me the give me the sudden teaching right away okay no you have to pass the test you have to go through the gradual training first and then there's a final test when you actually have to cut off your arm<br/>
01:48:17 | is that a question you asked do you have to cut off your arm yes i have a question it's another question a little bit random uh it's associated what you just talk about the conversation between ShenGuang and uh um Bodhidharma yeah like i'm curious back then what kind of language they are using when they communicate with each other do they speak chinese or do they speak indian language how did they communicate with each other [Music] what did i tell you i will forgive you this one time you never ask a question i cannot answer okay i'm sorry okay don't do it again next question how do i know i wasn't there but if i have to lie to you okay how do they communicate that's a good question you see you're so lucky i am so lenient because i had the same question too i said you know the guy didn't speak chinese and the other guy didn't speak indian how could they talk snow red and all those things is not vocabulary come on i'm missing something here yes old monk [Venerable XianChi speaking in Vietnamese] ok let master XianRen translate this important message um master whatever the sage sageely people did we cannot talk about it but uh earlier we went through the story that the patriarch talked to the bird actually the bird asked the question and then the patriarch give it the instruction and then the bird understand and then another story is Yongan when she meditate and she saw amitabha buddha appeared wearing a yellow rope and she uh in her mind arrives a question like why the buddha where why amitabh buddha wear yellow rope and suddenly an answer came to her mind like wait until you die that's when i will wear a red rope so the buddha can communicate through the mind and the same thing like in 1976 when i was in the prison and then i in my dream i saw buddha appear and then i i have a question i had a question in my mind and then suddenly the buddha answered me using the vietnamese he didn't use chinese or english or whatever he used vietnamese to help me to understand so in the sutra avatamsaka sutra say that the buddha has a lot of different way to communicate to help beings understand you get that you buy that you believe anything do you when you think you think in what language you think in chinese yes yes in you think vietnamese or english english okay but you are vietnamese right okay vietnamese chinese her mother is vietnamese chinese okay so you have chinese here english here XiaoTai when you think what do you think in what language do you use chinese and english chinese and english half chinese half english very good okay you see so uh so what happened is that the thinking do you really think is in chinese or english how come she thinks in english how come you think in in chinese before you verbalize it right when you think chinese [Some Garbled Chinese] so these are thoughts how come sees she hears herself as in chinese and she hears herself as english why my master when i was a novice and i was supposed to train to sit sleep okay and i hate it i hate it say we suffer all day eat one meal a day and we can't even sleep with in comfort what kind of what kind of nonsense is this so i really struggled with that concept having to sit sleep and i tried two years unsuccessfully okay and then one night in long beach monastry after two years okay i was sleeping i started as usual with sitting and then eventually i slide down slowly slowly slowly slowly and lean against the wall and then pretty soon you unbuckle a little bit a little bit very slow motion and eventually us like that no no not even actually listening to our lecture seriously he's not even playing his kids out there and and one night i was doing that like every single night okay and one night i heard i heard master XuanHua's voice okay he said he said uh get up cross your legs he's screaming at me seriously and i immediately jumped up crossed my legs without thinking i was so scared i never saw him that angry i always have this you know the last time i saw me was you know he was dying okay he was on his deathbed he said oh i love you you know and you're all so good you're such a wonderful student and so forth okay but never been that angry before okay i was so scared i immediately crossed my legs and set the rest of the night in full lotus and right after that i could easily sit in full lotus every single night okay and the instruction he gave me was in in i call you i'm looking at her i'm calling your name in is the first time you attend my sutra lecture can i make use of you as a prop after 10 years he's finally attended my sutra lecture the first time is that right you never attended my lecture before i didn't count not until today exactly i think he spoke english he spoke in english okay yeah why it's more direct i think that's all i could think of because i think in english i don't think in vietnamese i think in english unless i talk to the vietnamese and then i think in vietnamese but typically when i talk to normal people non-vietnamese i think in english but when i talk to the old monk then i switch to vietnamese in my thoughts just like you that's just like the boy what happened to him now okay so the point here is that if master XuanHua can talk to me in english to make sure i understood because that's my pattern unless you're vietnamese i only think in english so in order to teach me he used english to make sure i got the message immediately no interpretation no translation yes green is it really he spoke english or yes it's just your mind translated i heard his voice that anger i am traumatized for the rest of my life and as i just think about revisit that moment i'm still shaking right now it's how scary he's violent that's when i first learned about violence it's okay to be violent towards your disciples okay yes so so the point here is that uh here's what happens your thought has no language thoughts have no language for example when i taught that boy yesterday the troublemaker about shame on you okay when he was about to cry you remember you know he fell on his butt his right butt and he got up and he was going like this and he's bound to to cry and i laugh and say so i said shame on you you know and he immediately got the message okay that right there when i taught him right there talking about shame okay it's not in english at all it's not in chinese at all he does not understand chinese i only taught him about this conscious thought called shame he got it right away he stood up and he didn't he didn't cry he stopped his he's about to cry so i immediately tested him and said you should be ashamed instead of crying so immediately yeah i'm not going to cry he ran over there and he hit himself so the communications had no language he got it so yesterday i was playing with him i taught him five different emotions and he got them all so the thought in communication has no language but you add another layer on top of yourself because you need to talk to your thinking mind so that's why you translated internally your wiring it translated from that thought language which is pure thoughts into english uh chinese excuse me taiwanese or chinese chinese mandarin okay whereas that one there is english okay so that's why that's how they could communicate it turns out by the way for important lessons important teachings you cannot afford to be be be distracted by languages so i'm sure that bodhidharma and venerable bodhidharma he when he wanted to teach ShenGuang he could talk to him directly through his mind and ShenGuang could understand okay and the this is the storytelling where master XuanHua would explain it to us in chinese and we translate it into english so it's for our understanding but for them it's direct very direct mind to mind if you will okay just like you um venerable Bodhidharma send him a thought okay ex talked him in in thoughts and ShenGuang would translate that thought into chinese if you will that's what happened does it help okay just remember no more questions today but he's uh the old monk is correct okay he's right but he does you understand that's the exactly the first layer is thought thought has no language thought is just taught when you you do mind you're able to read mind like venerable bodhidharma okay you can read people's mind that has no language okay he can read your mind her mind your mind is in chinese her mind's vietnamese and his mind and god knows what language we don't know okay so it doesn't matter at all so the first layer is thought thought is just thought and then next layer is language all right that's how it works next so this gradual teaching that bodhidharma did for ShenGuang span nine years it's very important okay do not expect immediate results like we in our era are accustomed to instant gratification it takes time okay it takes time to prepare it takes time to let the wine mature properly you cannot rush it even soy sauce needs to mature naturally is that clear or fish sauce for that matter go ahead wei mountain master when the that baby yesterday you play that he fall down did you read his mind [Laughter] yes now you mentioned it now you brought it up yes oh what a stupid question of course i did i mean occasionally because yesterday i i finally found my soul mate a mischievous mind that boy was causing trouble all afternoon for four hours while you were here the small gathering is still like five six of us get gathered together and talking and telling your stories and so forth the mind the boy was you know creating mischief after mischief and so forth oh this boy sounds like my kind of soul mate so i intrigued me i said so i was starting to say i was i started paying attention what he was going through his mind how does he create mischiefs so i was more intrigued by that okay so so i i so i was able to connect with him at that mischievous level that's it and you call it thought reading mind reading so be it guilty okay so anyway so bodhidharma uh so the real question is now how does he transmit the teaching<br/>
02:06:58 | mind to mind teaching this is very very precise language how is he gonna teach something he does not understand the language or speak the language okay you wouldn't i would not dare use the chinese to teach you mind to mind for example never because my chinese is horrible okay so but bodhidharma decided to transmit the sudden teaching the chan dharma door here okay translation for you chan dharma door here is sudden teaching because he taught<br/>
02:07:45 | the chan dharma door for nine years already the gradual dharma door okay venerable ShenGuang saw how bodhidharma was teaching him not by language not by thoughts but by what by what by what yes chinese person tests tests no tests that's too chinese anyone else yes from the philippines you you want to make it sound so like we are so international yes by his behavior no wrong philippines doesn't have it yellow yes emituofo by uh he sat for nine years as well anyone else old monk i'm sure the old monk wants to say something [Laughter] don't even translate green by uh let him suffer pretty good not quite but yeah it's pretty good it's pretty good it's pretty good excellent and you are devious i would be careful you know if i were your husband anyone else by doing so for example this is just my imagination okay please take a grain of salt there's no proof don't ask me how do you know i was talking a korean person you know two nights ago and she says why are you so sure you don't ask someone that you know are you sure you how can you be so sure i mean it's not not proper anyway what bodhidharma did for ShenGuang is that if you can imagine ShenGuang is his hot stuff he's revered by lay people he's he's uh he's well respected impressed by the heavenly beings okay he's a hot shot okay but ShenGuang is not used to kneeling behind someone like that so initially i assure you ShenGuang had thoughts of quitting he said this is nonsense okay it's going nowhere what am i doing let's go back and face death it's less embarrassing than this how can i explain to my supporters i knew behind this dark skinned monk bushy beard who ignores me completely okay and when these thoughts of quitting arose in in in in ShenGuang's mind bodhidharma would do something and the thought would die okay so ShenGuang actually received help from bodhidharma invisibly otherwise there's no way ShenGuang could have lasted nine years so what Bodhidharma did for ShenGuang is that he invisibly helped ShenGuang not quit otherwise you have quit nine years ago a long long time ago does it make sense to you no ordinary person unless they be they are sage would do this silly thing for nine years that's impossible that's totally nonsense unless he was helped is that clear okay so don't be so full yourself your progress actually is your practice has a lot of help from a lot of good guys we're on the good side of the fence of the railroad tracks okay when you do this good thing here you receive so much help trust me so ShenGuang got help from bodhidharma because budidharma would make sure that he was not he would not quit okay and then for example in the summertime it's very very hot okay and and ShenGuang was perspiring for example and he said i can't take this much i'm going to pass out this heat and all sun this is a light breeze so the dharma protectors would blow air cool air not hot air seriously when you are hot someone does this for you it's it changes it gives you the kind of relief that's so much appreciated so ShenGuang had a lot of help a lot of support because not only bodhidharma was helping him the dharma protectors around venerable Bodhidharma will also assisting him you know in so many invisible ways we on the good side guys if you think that the demons are causing a lot of problems out there i assure you the good guys are also helping us as well okay that's what happened that's the only way that this could have transpired in my opinion lesson don't be so full of yourself we're receiving a lot of help a lot more help than we are aware of all right say anyway<br/>
02:14:50 | okay yeah why do we go into uh 大慧宗杲 大慧宗杲 whatever okay uh so anyway the main thing here i don't know why we're going to do this this uh this uh that way here okay but my interesting the interesting point here is that venerable Bodhidharma transmitted the sudden teaching to okay and that is the seal behind the transmission from generation generation somehow they have to transmit the sudden teaching to next generation because that is the essence of chan that is essence of mahayana i'm sorry korean sunims chan is not it's not seon is not is not uh Huatou okay seon is the sudden teaching that's how you can tell whether you have real chan or not for example in japan they don't have sudden teaching at all there's no mention of it yeah from the documents i read in english no mention of sudden teaching it's all about you know hinayana aspects of child of meditation all right uh anyway i don't know why we had 43 here at the [unintellible] here uh real chan on the uh so so so after venerable bodhidharma taught ShenGuang okay that special sudden teaching right there ShenGuang immediately became enlightened that's how you transmit the sudden teaching then bodhidharma recognized ShenGuang yeah was was uh was uh was right there at the threshold okay and then uh ShenGuang who then later became HuiKe said uh uh now that the arm hurts<br/>
02:17:37 | yeah and he says uh my my i am troubled by my the pain my arm okay please help me uh calm my mind down and bodhidharma says bring me your mind i will calm it down for you and HuiKe says i can't find my mind how can i bring it to you okay i said then i pacified your mind and at that point HuiKe uh huike then [Music] cross the threshold and went into the world the realm of enlightenment<br/>
02:18:25 | time is up oh my god time is up so sorry korea okay so we end here today thank you all for coming and i'm sorry i i exceeded a time limit next time we continue 45 okay thank you you<br/>
