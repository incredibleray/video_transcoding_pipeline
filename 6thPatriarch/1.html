<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=638">00:10:38</a> |  Hello everyone! Today is the 23rd October 2021. Uh we gathered here to start discussing the sixth patriarch sutra, one of the most important document Buddhist scripture on the sudden teaching okay, which is a distinctive characteristics of the Chan school of Mahayana all right. So the full name is the six patriarchs dharma jewel platform sutra, okay. And on slide let's see we are redoing this because we did this like four years ago, four plus years ago, and when we first started for our for over four years ago, uh we uh my intention was the honor of my late Chinese teacher master XuanHua. And so who was hiding under his shadow and tried to explain to simply try to elaborate what he meant was my intention. And now the condition changed a little bit, so now we try to explain the sutra from the American Mahayana perspective instead of Chinese Mahayana perspectives. So uh that's why we are uh and we i we feel that it's worthwhile to do it again, and explain it in a way for people in the 21st century, especially western educated people. I'm not Chinese, but I try I'm sort of a hybrid person, I try to bridge the gap between the east eastern culture and the western culture. And luckily for us, we have a lot of very competent Chinese-speaking people as well, so and Taiwanese as well, no disrespect intended to the Taiwanese people, so it is a collaborative effort. I hope you all pitch in, and we will each other we learn from each other, and make this a richer and more rewarding experience. In particular, this is a very auspicious, because uh we also have the Korean audience as well. Korean is a culture a Buddhist culture that emphasizes Chan meditation, in particular the HuaTou, they put a lot of emphasis on that and so this is an in a small way a liberal contribution to their chain culture, and they call seon culture as well okay, so welcome all of you! Thank you very much! Okay god when you get on your knees like, that is it me? Thank you. All right like so uh six uh that's uh jump right into it uh<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=836">00:13:56</a> |  The sixth patriarch is the six patriarch from a Chinese lineage. The first patriarch was Indian, there's a venerable great master Mahākāśyapa, so there is a first patriarch of the orthodox line lineage of orthodox Buddhism. So the very important thing here we need to take away from this is that, this is uh where, if you want to learn Buddhism, if you want to learn Mahayana, this is where you should go and look for good teachers, these patriarchs all right. So it started in India, and then eventually it was transferred from India to China and to via venerable great master Bodhidharma, and the 28th patriarch okay<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=889">00:14:49</a> |  Is there a question on JMT, or just my imagination? Because the sign keeps on flashing, that you know, or is it just uh Malcolm who cannot decide uh between uh Seoul and uh and JMT, huh? Anyway, is it you, Malcolm? Yeah, I recognize his flaming hair yeah now today, yesterday is that uh it's in Seoul and today is in at uh jewel mountain temple. Yeah hello, yeah the world traveler! [Laughter]<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=934">00:15:34</a> |  All right, so the venerable great master Bodhidharma brought the Mahayana transferred Mahayana from India to China, because that's at the time, that's where the next competent students would be found. This is a problem with patriarch, they need to go where the students are so that they can teach them and train them, okay. So at that time, venerable Bodhidharma had to go to India from India to China, he abandoned India, his Indian disciples, went cold turkey to China on his own, by himself, no entourage okay. And he went there and to transfer the Indian Mahayana knowledge to the Chinese, uh the first patriarch was, so he became the first Chinese patriarch. So he's like holding two hats: Indian patriarch, 28th patriarch from India, and first Chinese patriarch, all right. So and he transferred it to the uh the second Chinese patriarch by the name of HuiKe, okay. So what did he transfer? They didn't quite say it, but what he transferred is had to be the sudden teaching. Mahayana is about the sudden teaching, if you don't have sudden teaching you cannot teach Mahayana, if you don't understand the sudden teaching you cannot really train the next generation at all, and that's a constraint. And that's why uh when we got to the sixth patriarch, six Chinese patriarch, we're in venerable HuiNeng okay, he was there around the 8th century a.d all right. So now it's light number four<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=1070">00:17:50</a> |  In contrast, if you look at the Hinayana hierarchy of Buddhism, then you have to you want to learn Hinayana, then I have tremendous respect for the Thai people, the Thai Buddhist system. Why is that? Because they have a long history of training people. I met some of the recent head monks, Thai monks, and they are very good, they are really uh pretty good levels of arhats, four-stage arhats, and therefore that system consistently passed on that knowledge to the next generation. This is the key to Buddhism, Buddhism is about once you have the knowledge, once you have the wisdom, it is behooves upon you to pass it on to the next generation, you cannot let it discontinue at all. So that knowledge about the sudden teaching in Mahayana must be passed on to the next generation okay, and similarly, in Hinayana they have a way of training people so that they have a tremendous success, they produce a lot of four-stage arhats and probably pratyekabuddha as well, even though I haven't met any yet okay. So that's the distinctive characteristics over there. And uh, so they have a lot of uh Thai uh jargon here, they're they're big shots and uh just between us uh, don't say this don't quote me okay, among them are Bodhisattva, they're gonna be offended, I saw some of them are bodhisattvas okay. You know why it's important? Because the bodhisattvas help defend them against the demonic perversion in the system, because they spot those things and say no, no cut this off, this is why you call the doctor and cut off the limb, this is a bad limb, cut it off, cut it off okay, otherwise the system will be what's the word Master XianJie? Tainted? What else? Um, I'm not sure what we're looking for right now, sorry. Okay, I'll what is the more polite term for polluted? Deteriorate, it is too uh scholar scholarly, is it like corrupted? Corrupted, thank you! It's very serious, if you let corruption sneak in, that's the beginning of the end. Just like speaking of uh governments and policy and so forth you know, we go to another country and try to change government and change the political system and all, and you don't guard against corruption in government, that's it, it will never work. Never ever never happened, never worked in Vietnam, for example, okay, never worked in any country as a matter of fact. If you have corruption in the system will fall, so what happened, never mind about politics, and you know uh so what happened is that, in the Thai system, they have Bodhisattva disguising themselves as arhats, and they are not in power, they only serve in advisory roles. And and and that's why the system is so healthy so strong, because of that reason they have protection. Because if you leave alone it alone to the arhats, the arhats can still be fooled okay, so that's why that's why in terms of Hinayana I highly recommend you want to learn my Hinayana thing go to Thailand, I highly recommend it okay.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=1364">00:22:44</a> |  And they have a council. I know briefly about it, I met the head guy from Thai council, yeah he is a fourth stage arhat for sure, and uh he has spiritual penetrations as well and so forth okay. So these people for real folks, they're worth the worthy of our offerings okay, I would not hesitate to make offerings though okay. Yeah, uh and uh the supreme patriarch is uh this uh great monk here, Rattanakosin.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=1393">00:23:13</a> |  Okay uh since 2017 and so forth, look how young he is! Yeah. Young looking, he is okay and uh all right. so that's the Buddhism right there. If you want you are a believer in Hinayana okay, and you say Mahayana not for me, go to Thailand. I don't care whoever you are, okay, it's a great place to learn. Yes sir yellow. Be the more proper adjective corrupt? Yeah, corrupt, yeah, thank you! Thank you very much! All right I stand corrected, I should be more corrupt okay. Corrupted is not quite correct, okay, all right. So going back to our small world of Mahayana, because in the west right now Master XuanHua transmitted his knowledge of the sudden teaching to this country already okay, meaning that the fact from a fresh from a professional perspective, the people here are better recipients of that teaching then the people back in his country, as a fact okay, no disrespect intended for the Taiwanese either all right. So he had to go to this country to the US to transfer the sudden teaching dharma door okay, so as Americans here, Americans have no color skin color by the way, as you can look around, you only hardly any white-color skins here at all you see, and that's a nature of American Buddhism. American Buddhism people think American is like you know, it must be Caucasian, no! American is a mixed you know thing, and and and uh and that's what makes America superior in my mind, is that the ability to absorb and embrace everything, that is the spirit of Mahayana right there okay. <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=1546">00:25:46</a> |  So he had to go to this country, master XuanHua okay, brought this Chinese Mahayana to the US. in particular, he brought the dharma door of the sudden teaching okay. Sudden teaching meaning that, those of you who are not familiar with this sudden teaching, meaning that with this teaching meaning you have to hear it you have to, someone has to speak it okay. And with when you hear this, when you read this, you can attain enlightenment suddenly okay. Only in Mahayana can you have that okay, and so this uh the six patriarch taught this uh method of sudden enlightenment if you will okay, and uh and so uh this dharma door here actually has many access routes, it leads to that door called certain enlightenment. But to get there has many pathways, if you will, all right. Questions? This is very important, this is a momentous moment in China when my great master Bodhidharma went to China and decided ah I'm gonna teach HuiKe, great master HuiKe, this sudden teaching thing. And then master HuiKe then transferred it to the third patriarch, who transferred the fourth patriarch, who transferred it to the fifth patriarch, master HongRen, who then transferred that sudden teaching to master HuiNeng, and we'll find out a little bit later all right. So this is very important, and by the way, okay as Americans okay the mindset should be that we should be grateful to the Chinese for this gift, because you know it's a gift that will have tremendous consequences for us, our generation as well our children's generation, and further, further down the road as well okay. This is a very critical heritage that we are leaving behind, okay. So that's why we uh since master XuanHua didn't really elaborate that much about the sudden teaching when he taught this in how long ago, I don't remember anyone knows he taught this, he explained the sutra, explained the six patriarch sutra is one of the popular explanations out there. For in Mahayana a lot of people, Buddhists and non-Buddhists like would read up on his books, they find it very, very interesting, very insightful. And, but he never really elaborated that much on the sudden teaching, which is what venerable HuiNeng specialized in doing okay. So we'll dwell more on that side.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=1747">00:29:07</a> |  Right number eight, uh and at the time at the time Buddhism uh was there in China already okay, but just like nowadays just like typically what happens that, that people studied books studied scriptures and did ceremonies, and so what it's called very superficial cultivation okay. Substance is what Mahayana is about okay, it's about uh the core, your core your heart, it's not it's not about appearances, not about temples, it's not about fame reputation all right.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=1827">00:30:27</a> |  Go ahead, Korea JMT. Good morning from Korea! Good morning, um good afternoon to you too. Good morning there, and good afternoon here [Laughter]. Master, did Bodhidharma walk from walk all the way on foot from India to China? [Music] not true! It's uh it's a myth what actually happened, it sounded good but what should happen is the Chinese would like you to believe that he walked, but it's not true. Actually, what happened is he boarded a boat, he didn't swim either, and then he walked to Vietnam, that's true yeah. Monks couldn't uh couldn't ride horses, they can't, they can't ride horses, only for pets but not for riding, uh that's how they keep horses. Yes go ahead uh flaming hair. Uh master this is more of a comment, there's a there's a rapper I listened to, and he wrote a book, and Bodhidharma was mentioned, and he's he was that's where I got that from, he walked from India to China. And um he actually mentioned Chan in the book and then that zen came from Chan like the Javanese zen, so I thought that was pretty cool that he they. Um, this is kind of a rap song? So it's a rapper that got me into the um, the Asian culture a long time ago. Yeah, I hear right, you listen to rap. Not as much anymore. Good for you! [Laughter] I'm open-minded, but there are certain things I just can't stand, just kidding. All right very good<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=1958">00:32:38</a> |  Yes, Wei mountain. Oh god, I always get in trouble when I joke too much. Master, where did Bodhidharma go to Vietnam? In Vietnam, oh my my my province Huế definitely. Central Vietnam, no hesitation, no doubt. <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=1979">00:32:59</a> |  Yes uh over here black. So it is the tradition story that Bodhidharma came to China, um well actually, while he was trying in China he traveled well. No sorry I think when he came to China he um can buy a piece of leaf and then no go across the water right? No no no no no no no. you Chinese, a nice try. No no no no no no, you're distorting the fact, you're china's china person, no no. you can't, you can't sneak that in, no no no no no. I think uh he boarded a boat, I think a viking boat yeah. Um it was coded as an example of um you actually can show um spiritual power as a Chan master to teach people. When he was in China, he crossed a river on a leaf. oh yeah. See, your Chinese history is so mixed. I saw the Indian Ocean, I guess the Indian Ocean is an ocean, it's not a river. Yeah, yeah okay get your Chinese facts straight please. All right yeah he did cross, actually that's very famous yeah there are plenty of uh drawings of him on a leaf yeah. oh I think uh that's when uh they showed up like, yeah that's Chinese. He uh he came from the north when after he talked with Emperor Wu of Liang, and then he pissed off the Emperor Wu of Liang, and then he left the northern china to go to southern china, I think that's where the story of the one leaf crossed the river yeah. He crossed a river and on a leaf that's true okay yeah, and uh not clear on how what propelled him okay all right, but it's true that he did cross water on a leaf, that's pretty impressive okay. Uh and uh, and so he was actually pretty desperate looking for someone, so anyone please who wants to learn Mahayana I know from me, take it off my hands okay. The Chinese: no no, you're too black, I mean your skin too dark, we don't trust you. So you know, so he really struggled, and finally he found a yellow soul, I mean a Chinese soul who took it from him okay. And we're grateful for that, my point here is that in all due respect okay, i personally I'm grateful to Chinese culture, I feel it's because when the great master Bodhidharma transferred the Mahayana to China, he really the Chinese Buddhism that I learned, Mahayana Buddhism I learned is tremendous, so profound, it's so beautiful so wonderful, and it's a gift to the world really. You should transcend the national barriers and races and genders and so forth, because this Buddhism here is to me, it's beauty, it's just like you looking at a piece of art, it's to me, it's like that. You look at a statue of Rodin, or what's a guy who lost his ear, cut his ear to give to a prostitute girlfriend? Van Gogh okay. Those things are just beautiful, I mean look at this like wow yeah you know, it makes you feel good in your heart. You know, it's not the visual thing you look at, that yeah I mean it connects from that painting to your heart directly okay, through the stomach. But um yeah but so I'm grateful, I don't know about you, I'm so grateful that the Chinese Buddhism because what we got from them, what I got from Master XuanHua is so beautiful. The first time in my life after I learned Mahayana, I said: wow! This is wonderfully beautiful, okay. Mahayana helps you appreciate beauty, okay.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=2258">00:37:38</a> |  Yes, was there a question somewhere? Master, what is the meaning behind venerable Bodhidharma leaving on the leaf? Because this has been thousands of years and there's a lot of painting about it. Painting him what leaving across the cross the river by one piece of one leaf, I have no idea okay, when I'm able to do that I will explain it to you. And don't hold your breath, okay. Uh you Vietnamese people weird you know, I'm just talking about the depth and the beauty of Mahayana he says let's go back to floating on a leaf across the river, what's beautiful about that? To me, it's an Indian show-off, okay. I'm we're talking about beautiful Chinese people, Chinese things okay and Taiwanese too. Yeah, it's so difficult nowadays, you know to not offend one and and and please the other.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=2331">00:38:51</a> |  Here uh it's about it's about uh, the emphasis of this sutra here is actually uh about cultivation. In order to learn about the sudden teaching here, you need to grind it out first, you need to bear the discomfort and keep grinding and grinding, and when you are ready, that's when the sudden teaching is bestowed upon you. And boom! You leap okay, any questions okay. And and and uh this is a function of the sudden teaching, is a function of the responsibility of the great teachers. And in a way, to be fair uh master XuanHua did transmit the sudden teaching to his disciples, but low level sudden teaching all right, and you pay attention to how he explained the six patriarch suture you find that yes, there are some allusions to a sudden teaching, and when master XuanHua explained it, but he didn't really go into greater depths, so hopefully we add more to it. This is important because remember okay what we what I call America Mahayana is hardly by the skin color okay, look at us the Asians are taking over Silicon Valley, let's face it [Laughter] all right. Okay on the Koreans they have no sense of humor, and this is there ah these poor Koreans a long way to go all right. <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=2443">00:40:43</a> | So jewel is his dharma that is precious, and jewel is uh is when you hear jewel or gem that's a great value, it's highly desirable, and it's so Chinese. To me, I would prefer first Americans to look at the beauty of the dharma, the dharma is beautiful, the dharma I assure you, if you understand the dharma, you see the beauty. What kind of beauty? Uh Estée Lauder, Lancôme? No! The Beauty of people's hearts. The heart you cut it up can be very beautiful, when you look at it, not with the knife okay, people's hearts when you get to recognize, you get to see them people's hearts is so beautiful. And yesterday I was playing with a kid, a naughty naughty kid okay, and it's amazing I tell you this: you know I was playing with the kid, and I was teaching at the same time, I was teaching the kid about emotions, and yesterday he was playing, and he tripped he fell on his butt, the right butt. So he was gathering himself up and touching his butt and was deciding should I cry now, or what I'm entitled to cry, am I not? And he was as he was thinking, I laughed at him, I made fun of him, and he immediately got the message, and said I'm so this is so embarrassing, how could I fall like this, he hit behind he ran away and hit immediately okay, so kids heart can be so beautiful too you know. Anyway, so the jewel here to me, it's not it's not the gem like a Chinese people would like, the Asians like to think, you know the Indians are into gold, Chinese are into jade okay, girls are into diamonds. I heard, and I'm into vajra okay, vajra is beautiful okay. But primarily, you know it is the heart that interests me about this Mahayana here, and the heart here is uh the heart of Mahayana, the heart of master HuiNeng, in particular, is precious. It's rare and to me, it's sublime all right.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=2629">00:43:49</a> |  Platform apparently on slide number 10, platform is where the place where the sutra is spoken, is NanHua okay. In that famous temple there and they built a platform like here uh about 10 feet. Uh Wontek Sunim, how tall is this when you build this, you remember? How tall is this? Not even 31 inches okay, and uh and the platform is a place, a revere place pure place where they did important things in Buddhism, they transmit the precept substance from the heart from the master to your heart, that's what it happens, and then they speak the dharma to shape the heart okay, and that's called Buddhist plastic surgery all right, seriously they knew about plastic surgery back then already. <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=2699">00:44:59</a> | uh all right 11. sutra is anything that's spoken by the buddha to teach us about cultivation and and and sutra here has a meaning like to attract, it's a it's a it's the logic the uh beauty of the teaching, you know the uh the superior intellect the superior wisdom is very attractive to most of us. and it's a and and it's designed to give us directions on how to what? the chinese like to say to cultivate, i don't think of cultivation, i'm thinking sutra is teaching us how to live our lives to the fullest whether you're a left home person or a lay person okay. sutras are supposed to do that, supposed to teach us how to live okay, be happier our lives okay, and when you're happy okay you share it with your family, you share it with your students, you share your co-workers okay, and uh in particular this way of practice here is in accord or consistent with the intent of the buddhas, and the wisdom of the buddhas all right. so this sutra here is very special because because it is um it is the first time in chinese buddhism, and i don't know it happened in indian buddhism or not, but in chinese buddhism buddhism is the only time that the sutra was uh recorded, and the teaching was recorded and classified as a sutra when it was spoken by a chinese monk not the buddha okay. so it's very very special, it's really a a a treasure to the chinese okay, so we should be grateful here in our era us here in this country that we're able to receive this as a gift from the chinese okay, you need to give credit where it's due, so we need to be good to be grateful to the chinese uh kindness and generosity via master XuanHua okay. all right at least i am grateful, i don't know about you okay. so when he is explaining sutras we go through the TianTai school for general analysis to give us an overview what to expect from the sutra, so explain the names uh and and uh according to that the TianTai school, the sutra is by the title it refers to a person and a dharma analogy and a place and so forth, uh blah blah blah you know you can you can look it up, i'm i'm not interested in these things, uh it's too TianTai for me. and discriminating is the substance, uh it's talked about real mark as substance, and the real mark here is a very advanced concept for enlightened people, and this is the distinctive characteristics for chinese buddhism okay. real mark is is by definition, real mark is no mark but uh but nothing is without mark okay, 實相無相無不相 is the chinese thing, i memorized couldn't understand it 25 years ago okay, that's all you have to do, memorize it: no mark but nothing without mark, that is real mark all right. <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=2958">00:49:18</a> | Yes, yellow. Master, just a quick question: is it possible that the sixth patriarch is a reincarnation of Shakyamuni Buddha? No! He's Vietnamese, I'm glad you asked. We hear this a lot, you know, my late Vietnamese master said, you know I have proof, I have written a book on how the six patriarch is Vietnamese, I said oh I know you want to live in your temple, so I'm not going to disagree with you [Laughter]. Uh it's so easy reincarnation in the Buddha my in my humble opinion, I feel he's a Buddha okay, because of his depth. He's my teacher is Chinese, and he's he's his level is very, very high okay, but when you look at his teachings, the way he taught his disciples, see I'm he knew, and he taught me three times directly in person, and the other time is like I hear you know, I go crazy like flaming hair ah yeah there we go again, we wouldn't believe it. Yesterday I was talk that taught me about five six different emotions, he became just like that, oh no now he has a companion all right. So uh so easy is he a Buddha, I feel that he's a Buddha because the teaching is so profound, so beautiful you will okay, but I don't think he is Shakyamuni Buddha at all okay, uh because that would be a bad president and the Buddha came he left, and he came back again, say what? He has nothing else to do? I mean it's like if you leave, please go, don't come back, to me, it's just like doesn't make sense, there's no point being so sticky, and the Buddha comes and goes, and let the next Buddha come give them a chance you know, so you know you guys are too sticky, no no, I hope it's not Shakyamuni Buddha, but I don't know, because you asked me about state of Buddha, wrong person to ask okay. Ask something I know, not something I don't know, okay. What is the principle here okay, uh to become a Buddha, all of us can become a Buddha okay, message don't sell yourself short, no discrimination okay, so that's uh it's uh anyone can become a Buddha, that's why no that's why that's why now is our chance okay, we don't have to go to China anymore. Although you know you want to learn tai chi, I still feel we need still need to go to China wudang okay, I will go to wudang for about a year too, I would love to go there and learn you know, I hear speaking of walking on leaves, I hear they walk on walls, I saw a demonstration he actually walked on walls, I was so impressed, I said wow anyway. Yeah, so you can realize buddhahood, you can, all of us can okay, no one is exempt, even the lady back there who's half asleep, she can too, the sudden teaching is that we can all become a Buddha just like that. That she must have to cross her legs, just kidding, it's a requirement. You think it's free, you know, we have to work for it. And the function is to understand the mind and see your own nature here, understanding the mind is very interesting, you get to see how the mind works, your mind how your mind works, and once you understand how your mind works, you begin to be able to see how Yin's minds work you see all right. And the teaching mark is uh oh god it's so scholarly, sutra like sweet do heavenly elixir immortality, yeah so Chinese. I don't like these concepts because it makes you greedy, you know, it's like makes you so special. I'm listening to six patriarch sutra, hello mama from China! [Laughter] I'm glad you made it, the last time I saw you in Wei mountain temple [Music]. So this uh not only is beautiful, but it's very tasty, you can taste you know that has to be real. When you listen to the sutra and so, every now and then you might get to the state where actually when you swallow your saliva, it's kind of sweet, that's a sweet dew right there, it happens all right, and teaching period is uh this uh happened during the flower uh dharma flower or Lotus-Nirvana period, and then so forth okay. All right, any questions? I'm not, as you have noticed by now, I'm not interested in scholarly things, I'm just like this raw and uh and uh limited person. I'm more interested in something that uh that's a beautiful, tasty and that kind of thing, you will have my interest but scholarly things I leave it to the PhD people all right. <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=3377">00:56:17</a> | Um five Chinese patriarchs okay, now you should uh be you should know about okay that's how uh Chinese Buddhism uh started to take root in China, this is important because we need to know for our generation, how are we going to make these American Mahayana take root okay. We are right now I'm my second generation, you're a third generation therefore it helps to go back to how it happened in China okay, because we learned from a Chinese anyway. And so it's uh it's set from the uh song of enlightenment, another famous Chinese uh creation by the seventh patriarch that he recognized Bodhidharma was a 28th patriarch okay in that proper or orthodox line of Mahayana Buddhism okay, and all the Indian prior patriarchs from 1 to 27 followed Bodhidharma to he brought all that Indian heritage from India to China and conferred upon the Chinese, so the Chinese inherited all the Indian wisdom okay, and that's what is meant by transmitting the wisdom from India to China okay, it became Chinese the Chinese became the guardian of the Indian wisdom, and and and later on after six patriarch the Chinese Buddhism later on really prospered and blossomed, they produce many great talents many great patriarchs, that I feel that for us in our era our times, we should spend the time to learn Chinese and study these great Chinese teachers because the depth of Mahayana I keep on telling you, this is in the Chinese language not in English yet okay, so if you want Mahayana wisdom, deeper wisdom, higher level wisdom you have to learn Chinese okay, any questions about that? So you know where to find look for materials and where to look where to look for in terms of great teachers, it's not you know the uh the Chinese teachings, patriarch teachings actually much higher level than here that's available in English, that's a fact okay, so for you those of you out there who feel that you understand Mahayana, I strongly urge you to learn Chinese because you should go back to the Chinese teachers okay, and in the future I hope you transfer translate that teaching from Chinese into English okay. In order to do that, you have to learn Chan, Chan is a requirement okay, without Chan you cannot have the proper translation, and you find in the sutra that we use an old version of my master's disciple's translation, and it has quite a few things that missed the mark completely okay.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=3603">01:00:03</a> |  And so there are some significant patriarchs: Mahākāśyapa, don't have much teaching from him. Ananda and then the second patriarch. Fourteen patriarch very famous, they were Nagarjuna, Nagarjuna. How do you say it, flaming hair? Wow! Master, I don't know, but um not what naga-una. Okay and then an uh Nagarjuna and then uh Vasubandu is another famous uh famous Indian patriarch. <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=3664">01:01:04</a> | Next, 15. Uh, uh, Bodhidharma, we're talking about Bodhidharma, he is a prince in of a kingdom in Southern India. The king was a very devout Buddhist. It shows right there. If your parents are Buddhists, then you're bestowing great blessings on your children, because you give them exposure to the teaching of wisdom. Okay? Uh, so, so the conventional wisdom is that, is that, when you're born into a family as Buddhist, uh, you are incredibly, uh, blessed, if you will. Alright? Uh, hm, of course they are always exceptions. Uh, but not only was the king was a Buddhist, he was a devout Buddhist, and uh, and uh,  he made, uh,  offerings to the Patriarch. So he had access to the 27th Patriarch, okay? And he gave a priceless pearl to the Patriarch, okay? Uh. Lesson number two You have to make offerings to the Patriarchs, to the great teachers, okay? So this king here, not only was he devout, devoted to, uh, Buddhism, meaning that he helped propagate Buddhism, he also made a lot of offerings, supported the great teachers, the Patriarchs. Okay? And, because of that, his children have tremendous blessings, okay? And so this is a very special family. So when he offered a priceless pearl to the 27th Indian Patriarch, he showed the pearl, the Patriarch showed the pearl  to the three princes, sons of the King and asked "Anything more valuable than this pearl, uh, that I just received?" And the, the two older princes said, "Pearl is the most precious in our kingdom, and there's nothing better in the world." Very proud of it. <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=3826">01:03:46</a> | 16. The third prince, the youngest one, was Bodhidharma, who later became Bodhidharma said, "This  worldly pearl, uh, uh, is not the most precious thing. Uh. It is uh, among all the, uh, gems in the world, uh, the truth is the supreme jewel." Okay? Uh. So Indian. Okay? But, uh, but back then as a young prince, he had, he valued the truth already. Okay? He felt the truth was a treasure, that uh, that you, that uh,  should be cherished, not, not, uh, not gems and jewels. And the prince, uh, uh, continues. He says, "This worldly luster, uh, cannot be considered the finest. Okay? The light, the, the brightness, the light, that's most precious is uh, from the light of wisdom. Hm. And uh, the pearl, even though, uh, has lucidity, uh, uh, but the lucidity of the mind is uh, is the most desirable." Okay? So, uh, the young prince's, uh, uh answer is really outstanding. And so, so it showed that this, this young man here had potential to be taught, okay? And that's what great teachers recognize. They recognize people, they say, "Who can be taught? Who would be worthy of my efforts?" <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=3955">01:05:55</a> | Yes, go ahead, yellow. Speaker Yellow: "Ah, Master, regarding the pronunciation of Nagarjuna, Anthony heard from a disciple, uh, it's pronounced Nagarjuna." Master Yonghua: Nagarjuna? Speaker Yellow: "Yes, yes, that's what I heard from one of your disciples, I think." Master Yonghua: "Yeah yeah, I remember vaguely, I just cannot remember which uh, which uh, uh, uh, which syllable to put the inflection on. So I thought it was from flaming hair, but it's not, it's from someone else. Speaker: "Yeah. I think it's from someone else." Master Yong Hua: Yeah, someone else. It's clearly not flaming hair, flaming hair is still<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=3992">01:06:32</a> |  Uh- Alright, um, and uh, uh, and uh, and uh, Bodhidharma said a lot of things, that you know, Indians. They're, they're  wordy, and  they, they talk too much. Uh, uh. You know, from a Chan perspective, if I were the 27th Patriarch, which I'm not, I'd say, "You talk too much boy." Uh, uh,  So but anyway, clearly, this young prince here, has a special mind. He's, he's not impressed by worldly things. Okay? And it comes with, it comes with prior blessings. If you will. If your children have blessings, they'd be drawn to things of wisdom, okay? Instead of, they will not be impressed by the size of the temple. [Audience laughs] If I could influence you a little bit, [laughs] we're not like, uh, the kings who have palaces and three princes and so forth. You know, and, and so forth. What we have is big hearts. Okay. So, uh, I'm not interested in what the young Bodhidharma had to say to his teacher. He's not enlightened back then, so it's a lot of nonsense. Okay? But somehow the Indians were impressed, the Chinese were impressed, so they, they put this down. Okay, to me, it's too wordy. It's too many words, okay? It's not Chan-like. And later, he became better, okay?<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=4107">01:08:27</a> |  Uh, so after the King's father's death, uh, the young prince became a disciple, and, uh, and uh,  and became a monk, okay? So, you see, uh, right there again, the behavior of this person is similar to the Buddha's, Gautama Buddha's, where he, uh, was not impressed by worldly things, by luxury, by the, uh, the worldly pleasures, okay? He, he, uh, he uh, he followed his teacher, and he served his teacher for 40 years until  he died. Okay? Another, another, another, fact about Great Bodhidharma is that he serves his teacher, okay? Ah, and, and uh, and that's one of the most beautiful things you can do to show gratitude. He showed the reason, he's a prince remember, he's used to being, uh, treated like uh, the, uh, the potential future King, future Emperor, therefore he's supposed to be uh, idolized and so forth, but no. He revered his teacher and became a monk to serve him, um, uh, uh, for 40 years. That's very, very impressive, okay? And to me, there is no, uh, higher way, better way to express gratitude by taking care of your teacher, okay? Of a, of a great teacher like him. And, and uh, and that's one thing there that you can learn to spot children or people, okay? The common denominator of these great people is that they know gratitude. It comes from the heart. If your heart is big, your heart is full of gratitude. You don't always have to take, okay? You can give, okay? You give back to the people that did you great favors. Hm? Like your teacher, like your parents, like your ancestors and so forth, okay? Uh. That's what's uh, what special about the Asian culture, okay? Uh. You teach gratitude, by being grateful, not, not by talking about it, okay? And so Bodhidharma served his master for 40 years, that's very impressive, okay? Until his master died and, and his master, uh, asked him to go to China to uh, bring Mahayana from India to China. So basically, uh, named him the 28th Patriarch, okay? Hm. And when he came there, uh, didn't speak Chinese at all. So the Chinese were very, uh, discriminatory and looked at him and said, "Your skin is too black, and you're too-your beard, you have a huge beard," and you know, so they looked down upon this. They're scornful, uh, towards Venerable Bodhidharma, okay? <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=4346">01:12:26</a> | Uh. Don't know why the Chinese would draw Bodhidharma bare-chested, with a lot of hair. Do Indians have a lot of hair or not? Chest hair? They do? I never knew that. Watch the movies? [Laughter] Not! We're not watching the same movies! Is there a lot of dancing like [Master Yonghua mimics Bollywood music and dancing] [audience laughter] I know-you, you, they're talking all of a sudden, the man breaks out into dance and sings? [Master Yonghua mimics Bollywood music and dance] [Audience laughs] [Master Yong Hua laughs] Anyway, hairy chest. Uh. Why? Why you would draw him like that? Anyway. And then, <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=4404">01:13:24</a> | 21. He uh, he met with the emperor, the emperor of the Liang dynasty, Emperor Wu. This is a very famous interchange, okay? Hey, it's funny how children, there are so many children here today who are listening to these words of wisdom, and they have no clue what we're talking about. [Master Yong Hua laughs] It's fantastic. Ah. It's called brainwashing, you know that? It's called Buddhist brainwashing. You bring them here, and you put on- you can do the same thing at home, by the way. Turn on the, the, the tapes and, and you let them play, while they listen to all these things we talk about. It's called brainwashing. In the future, they become, they become, you know a monk, and with the Patriarch as well.  So Emperor Wu,  who is, uh, uh, who prided himself on, on being knowledge about Buddhism. He spoke to him through an interpreter, of course. And, um, who is that interpreter is probably, in my humble opinion, in my opinion, he's that interpreter, probably an ancestor, of our, of our precious Zhi Hong. Oh, you don't know Zhi Hong, it doesn't matter, okay. So Emperor Wu says, "Ah, in my entire life I helped a lot of monks and nuns uh, become monks and nuns," because when you become monks and nuns you need to have clothing, proper clothing. So he paid for the clothing, for the bowls, for the shoes and so forth, okay? And he built monasteries for them. So he said, "I've done all those and have a lot of Sutras copied, okay?  And uh, created a lot of Buddha images, okay. And how, how much merit did I earn?" Okay, Bodhidharma says, "None." And, and uh, says, "Good deeds done with  greed, worldly intent," okay, I would translate it as greed, okay? He did all this to impress people. Okay? When you do good deeds to impress others, it's, it's called worldly intent, is self-serving, in other words, okay? And so you're greedy for recognition, in other words. You're greedy for rewards, okay? Uh. That's the wrong way to do good deeds. You should do good deeds because,  there's a chance to do it. That's all. When we have the chance to do something good, just do it and then forget it. Okay? Uh. That's all. And, and uh, so Bodhidharma said, "You did a good deed, you bring good karma, uh, but no merit." Okay? <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=4602">01:16:42</a> | And the Emperor uh, uh, then pursued. He says, "What is the highest meaning?" So he, he didn't like it, so he changed the topic, you see? The Emperor's most convenient, but actually after he heard the first answer, he says "No merit whatsoever," he says, "You just lost an ear, boy," I mean Indian guy! [Master Yonghua laughs] So he said, "Okay, but I'm going to be civil, he's a Patriarch, supposedly. So, I can be, I'm an emperor, so I need to show my civil side." So he said, he changed the subject, and said. What he- He said, "What is the highest meaning of the noble truth?" Okay? See? He's very well-read. Bodhidharma says, "There's no, no, no noble truth. There's only emptiness." Okay? Bodhidharma actually, by then, was a little bit, uh, uh, cautious because he could tell that uh, the emperor was not happy with him, and there's no point in offending him even more than he needed to, needed to. So he said, "There's no more truth, there's only emptiness." Actually, he could have said from a Chan perspective, uh, what is the highest meaning of noble truth? Uh. Uh. He could have said, uh, nothing. But no, he said, "There's no noble truth, there's only emptiness." So you can tell he's scared. <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=4693">01:18:13</a> | 23. And then the emperor again was stumped. He said, "I can't pursue this, so let's give him another, uh, one last chance. Who's standing before me?" Okay? Meaning zhèn, zhèn is Chinese for "I'm better than you." You see? He says, "I'm better than you. I'm, I'm nobility, and you are, uh,  black. Um, dark-skinned, I mean." Uh. And Bodhidharma says, "I know not Your Majesty," okay? You know,  "I know not"- hmm, The proper translation should be, change it to, "I cannot tell." Master Xian Jie, don't just sit there, do something. "I cannot tell." You see? The, the immediate answer is so beautiful. He says, uh, I say, he says, "Duì zhèn zhě shuí." Um. Who's in front of me? Can you try, change it please? "Who's in front of me?" Okay? "Who's facing me?" Either one. Okay? And so the, the brutal answer from, from, Bodhidharma, he meant in English is, "I can't tell." Alright? Uh. So, and after that, the emperor gave up and uh, he said uh, uh, "Excuse me, I need to go take this phone call here. Uh. From Russia."<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=4841">01:20:41</a> |  And uh, so later, he had an advisor. Would you believe it's Zhi Gong? Zhi Gong is one of the, of the wisest Chinese monks, and what does he do advising this kind of emperor? Oh my goodness! I, I, I, when I got to this point here, I lost all respect for Zhi Gong. Because if you hang around this person, who was thirsty for power, recognition, greedy, he was so greedy, okay? The only way that you can help, is yourself. Because that's how he sees you. Okay? If Zhi Gong was a true Patriarch, a great, a person of great wisdom, he'd say, "I'm sorry, young master, okay, I'm not worthy of your patronage." Here's, uh, the master at the DRBA, go over there. Okay? Yeah so, uh, I, I, it's a personal thing for me because I know I was growing up, I mean when I was learning the Way, uh, Master Xuan Hua spoke so highly of Master Zhi Gong. He had spiritual powers and so forth. When I got to this point here, I said, "What are you doing, advising this emperor?" So he's this way because you advised him? So he's your creation. He's a product of your training, right? So, I would run, uh, okay? That's why Zhi Gong is, you know, out. Uh, uh. So Zhi Gong says, "Your Highness, uh, still don't recognize this person?" Bì xià hái shí cǐ rén fǒu? Hm. So you don't recognize this person, okay? And the emperor says, "Uh, uh, I don't." And Zhi Gong says, "This is Guan Yin transmitting the Buddha's Mind Seal." Okay? So Zhi Gong says Bodhidharma actually is, is Guan Yin. So clearly, Guan Yin has nothing else to do. But we, we have so many Bodhisattvas, and Guan Yin says, "Let me bring Mahayana from India to China. You, the rest of you can go on vacation, go to the Bahamas, or you, uh, take a hike, and you know, or something. Let me do it for you." So the rest of the Bodhisattvas say, [Master Yonghua makes bewildered expression] "So we don't get a chance to create blessings for ourselves?" Okay? So, I don't know about this Zhi Gong guy here. Okay? Yeah, with all due respect to the Chinese and Taiwanese people.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5022">01:23:42</a> | And um, and so the emperor heard that this is a Sage, so he was uh, he, he, uh, he had second thoughts and tried to, uh, send his, uh, uh, boy to ask the Venerable Bodhidharma to backtrack and come back so that he can make offerings and support him. Uh, uh, and Zhi Gong says, uh, "No, don't bother. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Even if, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh even if the entire nation goes, all our people go, okay, he  still wouldn't come back." Hm. Okay? Uh. So he says, uh, uh, gai guó rén qù And he says, "Even if we all go, okay? He still would not, will not come back. Not return. Would not come back." Alright? And so, this is a story of a transmission from India, uh,  Mahayana, from India to China. <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5104">01:25:04</a> | So Venerable Bodhidharma went to Nan Jing, listen to Dharma Shen Kuang, um, speak Dharma. And back then it's typical, as typical as it is nowadays, people speak Dharma without wisdom. They spoke words. They didn't, they didn't teach, uh, from the wisdom, but from regurgitating the, uh, the, uh,  the technical jargon. Uh. But even doing, even for uh, just doing so, the heavens rain fragrant blossoms and golden-petaled lotus rose from earth. Okay. And so he's uh, he's uh, an extraordinary Dharma Master, to the point where the heaven lands were making offerings to him. And so Bodhidharma stopped by, listened to his lecture, and waited for everyone to leave, and cornered down Master Shen Kuan, and asked him, "What, uh, what  are you doing?" And Shen Kuang says, "I am explaining Sutras. Can't you tell?" <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5180">01:26:20</a> | Uh. And he said, uh, "Why are you explaining the Sutras?" He said, uh, "The answer is, uh, to teach people to end birth and death." And Bodhidharma says, "How does it happen? Okay? The words are black and white, how does black and white, you know, uh, uh, things can end birth and death?" And Shen Kuang  couldn't have an answer. Uh.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5207">01:26:47</a> | And this is the lesson I learned: do not offend the Chinese Patriarchs, the Chinese Dharma Masters. Okay? It's okay for you to offend me because I'm not Chinese, uh, uh, but, but this is a common protocol, uh, in that, uh,  you don't, you don't ask questions that, that Dharma Masters cannot answer, okay? Please. And, uh, but Shen Kuang is able to- has a little bit of a temper, a temper. He got very upset, and he whipped out his beads, uh, made of steels, okay, and whacked them. He said, "These are the words of the demons," and broke the two front teeth. So Bodhidharma has a new nickname! Leon Spinks! [Audience laughs] Hm. Yeah, so, uh, you know, so whack him and say, "You're the demon! How dare you embarrass me! It's the demon's word! You're doing demons', you know..." And, and so he broke his teeth because Bodhidharma didn't dodge at all. I remember, and to this point I remember that video of President Bush, the small one, when he went to Afghanistan, someone threw a shoe at him, [Master Yonghua laughs] he went like this [Master Yonghua dodges] He ducked, and he ducked in this funny way too. [Master Yonghua dodges again] But Bodhidharma is like a true Indian Patriarch, stood there and lost two teeth. I hope he gets a good dentist. [Audience laughs] Can you imagine we speak Dharma and then as we smile, and the front of our mouth is black? [Maser Yonghua laughs] Oh yuh, yuh. What was he thinking? I would have ducked myself, like Little Bush.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5351">01:29:11</a> | And, uh, Bodhidharma, uh, uh, apparently, according to Chinese, the Chinese wisdom, it says, there's a legend where if a Sage's tooth falls to the Earth, it would not rain for three years. That's probably what happened here in California. Uh, and so Bodhidharma says, "That would harm a lot of people, so I better take the pain, uh, and suffering, uh, instead of, uh, letting bad things happen to the Chinese people, uh, although they deserve it." So, so, the tooth fell out, and so he swallowed it, okay? And then he went away, okay? And then, and then, according to Master Xuan Hua, yes. Did you have a comment? Black? White? Red? That, that video person, audio person he sits like he's in a trance. Yeah, Red. Speaker Red: "Right, yeah, so my question is, by swallowing the teeth, does, it solves the problem? So it will rain for three years, or it solved that problem or-?" Master Yong Hua: No, it wouldn't rain for three years for that. Speaker Red: "It wouldn't rain for three years?"  Master Yong Hua: You need the dragon's intervention, but at least there won't be a, uh, a drought for three years. Because it would, if, if he let the tooth, the teeth fell, fall to the ground, they would have a drought for three years. So, there would be no drought for the next, because of that, okay? So, uh,  uh, so, uh, he swallowed them and disappeared, okay? And, and, and uh, and so according to Master Xuan Hua, I remember this part. Master Xuan Hua said, uh, immediately right after that, and you know, please take a grain of salt, you know, he's not here, so we don't know. There are lots of things, folks, I wish I were there, because I have so many questions. I'm not like a typical American who is, you know, very afraid of Master Xuan Hua, I would have asked him, "Great Master, really? I mean, I hit the thing and all of a sudden, the fame of Shen Kuang was supposed to die right away? Do you buy that or not?" I find it's, it's too much a coincidence. What's the rationale for that? You believe it or not? When I read that story, I said, "Seriously? You hit someone and broke two teeth, I mean Leon Spinks never, you know, killed anyone because of that. No one died because of that." But, there is a point to this story. Why did he die immediately? Because he inflicted harm on a great, great Sage. Supposedly Guan Yin according to Zhi Gong, which I respectfully disagree, okay? Guan Yin would never fight with the Bodhisattvas. Would not compete for, for blessings from Bodhisattvas, I assure you, okay? We have so many great Bodhisattvas who are waiting, are craving to bring Mahayana from India to China. Why would Guan Yin Bodhisattva steal those merit and virtues from them? Hm? Think about it, it just didn't make sense to me, okay? Anyway! Uh, so, what happened is, this uh, this uh,  this monk here, this monk here, Shen Kuang, okay, injured a Great Sage. For that mere fact there, he's supposed to fall to the Avici Hell, the worst hells there is. Just for that. That's how serious it is. Okay? And therefore, it's perfectly reasonable to say that he's supposed to die right away, because you know how, how, how big of a name Bodhidharma was, then he deserves to die immediately, because it's a very serious offense.  So, so, he's supposed to die, so two ghosts came and said, "Our boss, King Yama would like to have a word with you," which is the, you know, the Underworld, uh, the word for, uh, okay, it's time for you to go. Okay, and Bodhidharma said, uh no, Shen Kuang says, "Why? I'm so young, in the prime of my life, you know? Can I have some more time?" He said, "Nope! Your time is up." "Just like that?!" He said, "Yep!" So, so, uh,  Shen Kuang, says, "What did I do? What did I do?" And he said, "You don't know? Hah! You broke the two front teeth of a Great Sage. That's why." And so Shen Kuang says, "Uh. Oh. I didn't know, if I knew, I would have not done it." Okay? The ghost says, "Not my problem." okay. "Let's go!" And uh, and uh, Shen Kuang got on his knees, I think and then begged to the ghost says, "Look at me, I'm the Dharma Master, you're the ghost. I beg to you, give me some time, uh, so that I learned from this monk a little bit so that my life would not have been in vain." Okay? And so, uh, the ghost must have been a high-ranking ghost,  he says, "Okay I'm seeing that you are sincere, I allow you a little bit of time, go and look for that monk and, and uh, and uh, do you think, we'll wait a little bit for you." And so Shen Kuang, uh, uh, ran after, after Bodhidharma.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5780">01:36:20</a> | By that time, okay, Bodhidharma was walking towards the south, yes he went south. Is it south? No, that's the Sixth Patriarch, you confused. So he went somewhere [Master Yong Hua laughs] And he passed by a house where they kept, there's a bird, is kept in a cage, a bird cage, okay? And, and uh, and uh the bird, uh, uh, uh recognized Bodhidharma and said, uh, recognize, somehow this bird recognized Bodhidharma as a Sage, so the bird asked him, "Mind from the West, Mind from the West, Teach me a way, To escape from this cage."<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5834">01:37:14</a> |  Uh, Flaming Hair, can you do it in, in a more birdy kind of way? Try your best. Bird language now. Very good, very good, yeah. One more time. [Audience laughs] Second version. Unmute it, hey Korea, unmute it. I can't hear you. Speaker Flaming Hair: "Can you hear me?" Master Yong Hua: Okay now, now. Go. Speaker Flaming Hair: "Mind from the West! Mind from the West! Please teach me how to escape from this cage!" [Master Yong Hua laughs] [Audience claps] <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5894">01:38:14</a> | Uh, and Bodhidharma immediately replied, "Okay, let's find a new voice." Uh, uh, China's Chinese person there. Huh? Uh. So Bodhidharma replied, "To escape from the cage; to escape from the cage, put out both legs, close both eyes, this is a way to escape from the cage!" Okay, spoke bird language. Uh, and, and uh, and uh, and uh, and uh, and uh, And that's what the bird did, and uh, the owner thought the bird was dead, so opened the cage and tried to take the body out, but the bird flew up, okay. So that's how the bird escaped, okay. The great escape, if you will, uh, but the bird escaped.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5957">01:39:17</a> | So anyway, the story, legend has it that Shen Kuang ran after Bodhidharma and went all the way to be a Bear's Ear Mountain in, in Lo Yang, and uh, sat down facing a wall that's right behind the future Shaolin Temple, okay? Hm. And<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5976">01:39:36</a> |  Shen Kuang knelt close by, um, behind him apparently, for nine years. And when I read this, I said nine years? Uh, how can you do that for nine years? Well anyway, so he sat for nine years, and I'm, first question is, uh, what about bathroom breaks? And uh, um,  and um, uh,  so they sat behind Master Bodhidharma for, for nine years, and Bodhidharma ignored him completely, didn't talk to him for nine years, okay? And Shen Kuang never gave up. It's a test. Hm? It's a test. And uh, test of sincerity, okay. And one day, after nine years, Shen Kuang never dared bother Bodhidharma. If you were there and begging for instruction, you don't want to nag him, you know. Qun, you hear? You don't want to nag. I would not nag, okay. For something important, I would not nag. Uh, uh. And, uh, and uh, um, mmm, and uh, and one day, uh, uh, uh, Bodhidharma asked him a question. This is very important. There's a protocol here. You would kneel behind, you ask for a favor you ask once, and you wait, okay, you don't nag. And then, and then, so he waited for nine years. This is beautiful, this is so beautiful of a story to me, okay? It is so important to you, he said, "How do I end birth and death? Venerable Master, teach me how to end birth and death." Alright? You don't text him to death. [Audience laughs] Okay, you ask once. How can I end birth and death, and then you kneel down and you wait. You can do anything you like, [Master Yonghua drops head from one side to another] but you don't nag him anymore. [Master Yong Hua looks behind] The timing is always perfect! [Audience laughs] And, and uh, so after nine years, interestingly, uh, this is so remarkable of Venerable  Shen Kuang, I'm impressed by that. That for us in my era, waiting for nine years behind him like that is total nonsense, the sheer nonsense. I don't know about you, I cannot do this, no way, it doesn't make sense to me, okay? Uh. That's why I'm glad that Shen Kuang did it for us. Thank you, China. [Master Yong Hua looks up] And, and um, and  after nine years, so it's like, it's interestingly like a delay, how do I, how do I end birth and death? Okay? And Venerable Bodhidharma didn't say anything for nine years, ignored him completely. And the guy would not go away, <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=6190">01:43:10</a> |  so after nine years Bodhidharma says, "You're still here? What's the matter with you?" And he said, "I'm waiting for the answer," and he said, "I will answer you when the snow becomes red." Okay? <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=6205">01:43:25</a> | And so Shen Kuang, uh, uh, uh, got so upset that he took out a knife and cut his left arm or right arm? This is what I don't remember. Is it the right arm? Right arm, okay. I am right-handed, so I think I would take my left arm, cut my right arm. It shows more-it's more emphatic. [Master Yong Hua laughs] So in this movie of mine, you take this knife here, this probably has not been sharpened yet, and you hack away your armor, [Master Yong Hua laughs] So anyway, so it finally cut off and fell to the ground, and the snow become red, became red. So he scooped up some red snow with, tainted with blood, corrupted with blood, and then, and then, and "So great Master, great Master, hey! This-the snow-there's red snow! The snow has become red!" And, now Master Xuan Hua says, Venerable Shen Kuang was so upset, he had a temper, so he cut his arm off to show him. Uh, he's probably right, I would never disagree with my, my Chinese teacher, okay? Yeah ching! [Master Yong Hua points above his head] [Master Yong Hua laughs] So, so,<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=6292">01:44:52</a> |  Bodhidharma was impressed, and um,  and he said, "Ah! You, you are a pretty tough cookie." And, and um, and um, uh, and uh, "So it is, so it is," he says, "Wow you're tough, so you're tough." Okay? Uh. Ru shi. Ru shi. So it is ru shi, ru shi. "You're so tough, so am I."[Master Yong Hua laughs] Okay? "You're crazy, so am I." Uh, and he says, he says uh, "You are worthy to be my student." Okay? "So I will teach you, I teach you what I know," okay? And "So my wait has not been in vain." Imagine this guy, this great teacher has been looking for a descendant, for a successor, for a long time. He saw it in Venerable Shen Kuang, but still put him through the test, okay? A lot of, in Buddhism, it's about enduring uh, the test, okay? And uh, that's called what? What is that called? Gradual teaching. The tests are gradual teaching. You see that? That's how Mahayana was transmitted from India to China. Gradual teaching for nine years. So he sat there, he knelt behind him for nine years. So every day, he said, "Oh my legs hurt, and it hurt so much, what am I doing here? What am I doing here? I can't even tell my mother about this. She doesn't want me to become a monk in the first place, now I have to tell her I'm kneeling behind this dark-skinned monk who cannot speak a single word of Chinese? And when he decides to teach me how we're gonna, what are we gonna use? Google Translate?" You see? It has so many issues there that's unresolved, okay? And yet he knelt, and Bodhidharma didn't talk to him, he didn't dare ask, okay? And, and uh, so, part of the teaching is you need to go through hardship, because that's part of your gradual training. Don't expect shortcuts. They say, "Tell me the best thing, Give me the Sudden Teaching right away, okay?" No, you have to pass the test, you have to go through the gradual training first. And then there's a final test where you actually have to cut off your arm.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=6497">01:48:17</a> |  Is that a question you asked, do you have to cut off your arm? Yes. I have a question, it's another question, a little bit random, uh it's associated to what you just talk about the conversation between ShenGuang and uh um Bodhidharma, yeah like I'm curious back then what kind of language they were using when they communicate with each other? Do they speak Chinese, or do they speak Indian language, how did they communicate with each other? What did I tell? I will forgive you this one time, you never ask a question I cannot answer, okay. I'm sorry. Okay, don't do it again, next question. How do I know? I wasn't there, but if I have to lie to you okay how do they communicate, that's a good question. You see you're so lucky I am so lenient, because I had the same question too, I said, you know the guy didn't speak Chinese and the other guy didn't speak Indian, how could they talk snow red and all those things are not vocabulary, come on! I'm missing something here. Yes, old monk [Venerable XianChi speaking in Vietnamese]. Ok, let master XianRen translate this important message. Um master whatever the sage sagely people did we cannot talk about it, but uh earlier we went through the story that the patriarch talked to the bird. Actually the bird asked the question and then the patriarch gave it the instruction and then the bird understood, and then another story is Yongan when she meditated, and she saw Amitabha Buddha appeared wearing a yellow rope, and she uh in her mind arrives a question like why the Buddha where why Amitabha Buddha wear yellow rope, and suddenly an answer came to her mind like wait until you die that's when I will wear a red rope. So the Buddha can communicate through the mind. And the same thing as in 1976 when I was in the prison and then i in my dream I saw Buddha appear, and then I had a question, I had a question in my mind and then suddenly the Buddha answered me using the Vietnamese, he didn't use Chinese or English or whatever, he used Vietnamese to help me to understand. So in the sutra, avatamsaka sutra says that the Buddha has a lot of different ways to communicate to help beings understand. You get that? You buy that? You believe anything, do you? When you think, you think in what language, you think in Chinese, yes? Yes. Yin you think Vietnamese or English? English. Okay, but you are Vietnamese, right? Okay Vietnamese Chinese, her mother is Vietnamese Chinese okay. So you have Chinese here English here, XiaoTai when you think what do you think in, what language do you use? Chinese and English. Chinese and English, half Chinese half English, very good okay. You see, so uh so what happened is that the thinking do you really think is in Chinese or English, how come she thinks in English, how come you think in Chinese? Before you verbalize it, right when you think Chinese, so these are thoughts, how come sees she hears herself as in Chinese, and she hears herself in English? Why? My master, when I was a novice, and I was supposed to train to sit sleep okay and I hate it, I hate it, said: we suffer all day, eat one meal a day, and we can't even sleep with in comfort, what kind of what kind of nonsense is this? So I really struggled with that concept of having to sit sleep, and I tried two years unsuccessfully, okay. And then one night in Long Beach monastery after two years okay, I was sleeping, I started as usual with sitting and then eventually I slid down slowly slowly, and lean against the wall and then pretty soon you unbuckle a little bit a little bit, very slow motion and eventually us like that. No no not even actually listening to our lecture seriously, he's not even playing his kids out there. And one night I was doing that like every single night okay, and one night I heard master XuanHua's voice okay, he said uh: get up! Cross your legs! He's screaming at me seriously, and I immediately jumped up crossed my legs without thinking, I was so scared, I never saw him that angry, I always have this you know, the last time I saw me was you know he was dying okay, he was on his deathbed, he said oh I love you know, and you're all so good, you're such a wonderful student and so forth okay, but never been that angry before okay. I was so scared, I immediately crossed my legs and set the rest of the night in full lotus, and right after that, I could easily sit in full lotus every single night okay. And the instruction he gave me was in, Yin I call you, I'm looking at her, I'm calling your name, Yin, is the first time you attend my sutra lecture, can I make use of you as a prop? After 10 years, he's finally attended my sutra lecture the first time, is that right? You never attended my lecture before, I didn't count, not until today. Exactly I think, he spoke English, he spoke in English okay, yeah why? It's more direct I think, that's all I could think of because I think in English, I don't think in Vietnamese, I think in English unless I talk to Vietnamese, and then I think in Vietnamese, but typically when I talk to normal people, non-vietnamese, I think in English, but when I talk to the old monk then I switch to Vietnamese in my thoughts. Just like you that's just like the boy what happened to him now okay. So the point here is that if master XuanHua can talk to me in English to make sure I understood, because that's my pattern, unless you're Vietnamese, I only think in English. So in order to teach me, he used English to make sure I got the message immediately, no interpretation, no translation. Yes, green. Is it really he spoke English, or yes it's just your mind translated? I heard his voice, that anger. I am traumatized for the rest of my life, and as I just think about revisiting that moment I'm still shaking right now, it's how scary he's. Violent, that's when I first learned about violence, it's okay to be violent towards your disciples, okay. Yes, so the point here is that uh here's what happens, your thought has no language, thoughts have no language for example, When I taught that boy yesterday, the troublemaker about shame on you okay, when he was about to cry, you remember, you know he fell on his butt his right butt, and he got up, and he was going like this, and he's bound to cry, and I laugh and say, so I said shame on you, you know, and he immediately got the message okay, that right there, when I taught him right there talking about shame okay, it's not in English at all, it's not in Chinese at all, he does not understand Chinese, I only taught him about this conscious thought called shame, he got it right away. He stood up, and he didn't he didn't cry, he stopped his he's about to cry, so I immediately tested him and said you should be ashamed instead of crying, so immediately yeah I'm not going to cry, he ran over there and he hit himself. So the communications had no language, he got it, so yesterday I was playing with him, I taught him five different emotions, and he got them all. So the thought in communication has no language, but you add another layer on top of yourself because you need to talk to your thinking mind, so that's why you translated internally, your wiring it translated from that thought language which is pure thoughts into English uh Chinese, excuse me Taiwanese or Chinese, Chinese mandarin okay, whereas that one there is English okay, so that's why that's how they could communicate. It turns out by the way, for important lessons, important teachings you cannot afford to be be be distracted by languages, so I'm sure that Bodhidharma and venerable Bodhidharma he when he wanted to teach ShenGuang, he could talk to him directly through his mind and ShenGuang could understand okay, and this is the storytelling where master XuanHua would explain it to us in Chinese, and we translate it into English, so it's for our understanding but for them, it's direct very direct mind to mind if you will okay, just like you um venerable Bodhidharma send him a thought okay, ex talked him in thoughts and ShenGuang would translate that thought into Chinese if you will that's what happened, does it help okay? Just remember, no more questions today. But he's uh the old monk is correct okay, he's right, but you understand that's exactly the first layer is thought, thought has no language, thought is just thought, when you do mind you're able to read mind like venerable Bodhidharma okay, you can read people's mind that has no language okay, he can read your mind, her mind, your mind is in Chinese, her mind's Vietnamese, and his mind and god knows what language we don't know okay, so it doesn't matter at all. So the first layer is thought, thought is just thought, and then the next layer is language. All right, that's how it works, next. So this gradual teaching that Bodhidharma did for ShenGuang spanned nine years, it's very important okay, do not expect immediate results like we in our era are accustomed to, instant gratification. It takes time okay, it takes time to prepare, it takes time to let the wine mature properly, you cannot rush it, even soy sauce needs to mature naturally, is that clear? Or fish sauce for that matter. Go ahead, Wei mountain. Master, when the that baby yesterday you played that he fall down, did you read his mind? Yes. Now you mentioned it, now you brought it up, yes. oh what a stupid question. Of course, I did, I mean occasionally, because yesterday I finally found my soul mate, a mischievous mind, that boy was causing trouble all afternoon for four hours while you were here, the small gathering is still like five six of us get gathered together and talking and telling your stories and so forth, the mind the boy was you know creating mischief after mischief and so forth, oh this boy sounds like my kind of soul mate, so I intrigued me, I said, so I was starting to say, I was I started paying attention what he was going through his mind, how does he create mischiefs, so I was more intrigued by that okay. So I was able to connect with him at that mischievous level, that's it, and you call it thought reading mind reading, so be it, guilty. <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=7618">02:06:58</a> | Okay? [Master Yong Hua laughs] Uh. So anyway, so Bodhidharma, uh, uh, so the real question is, now, how does he transmit the teaching, mind to mind teaching. This is a very, very precise language. How is he gonna teach something he does not understand the language, or speak the language? Okay, you, I would not dare use the Chinese to teach you mind to mind, for example. Never, because my Chinese is horrible. Okay, so, but Bodhidharma decided to transmit the Sudden Teaching. The Chan Dharma Door here, okay? Translation for you: Chan Dharma Door here is Sudden Teaching. Because he taught the Chan Dharma Door for nine years already, the Gradual Dharma Door, okay?<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=7665">02:07:45</a> |  Venerable Shen Kuang saw how Bodhidharma was teaching him, not by language, not by thoughts, but by, what? By what? [Master Yong Hua shakes his head] Mmm. By what?  Yes Chinese person? Speaker Chinese person: "Tests? Tests?" Master Yong Hua: No tests. That's too Chinese. Anyone else? Yes, from the Philippines. [Audience laughs] You want to make it sound so, like we, so international! [Audience laughs] Yes. Speaker from the Philippines: "By his behavior." Master Yong Hua: Nope, wrong, the Philippines doesn't have it. [Audience laughs] yellow, yes. Speaker Yellow: "Emituofo uh, he sat for nine years as well." Master Yong Hua: [Master Yong Hua yawns] [Audience laughs] Anyone else? Old monk, I'm sure the old monk wants to say something. [Audience laughs] Venerable Xian Chi: [Vietnamese] Master Yong Hua: Eeeh! Don't even translate! [Audience laughs] Green. Speaker Green: "By, uh, let him suffer." Master Yong Hua: Pretty good. Not quite, but yeah, it's pretty good, it's pretty good. It's pretty good, excellent. And you are devious. I would be careful, you know, if I were your husband. Anyone else? By? Doing. So, for example, this is just my imagination, okay? Please take a grain of salt, There's no proof. Don't ask me [Master Yong Hua points at an audience member] how do you know? I was talking to a Korean person, you know, two nights ago, and she said, "Why are you so sure?" You don't ask someone that, you know, are you sure? How can you be so sure? I just, it's not proper. Anyway, what Bodhidharma did for Shen Kuang is that, if you can imagine, Shen Kuang is hot stuff, he's revered by lay people, he's uh,  he's well respected, impressed by the heavenly beings, okay? He's a hot shot, okay? But Shen Kuang is not used to kneeling behind someone like that. So initially, I assure you, Shen Kuang had thoughts of quitting. He said, "This is nonsense, okay? It's going nowhere. What am I doing? Let's go back and face death. It's less embarrassing than this. How can I explain to my supporters I kneeled behind this dark skinned monk, bushy beard, who ignores me completely?" Okay? Hm. And when these thoughts of quitting arose in, in, in the in Shen Kuang's mind, Bodhidharma would do something- [Master Yong Hua heavily coughing]- and the thought would die. Okay? So Shen Kuang actually received help from Bodhidharma, uh, invisibly, otherwise there's no way Shen Kuang could have lasted nine years. So what Bodhidharma did for Shen Kuang is that he invisibly helped Shen Kuang not quit. Otherwise, he would have quit nine years ago, a long, long, time ago. Does it make sense to you? No ordinary person, unless they be, they are a sage, would do this silly thing for nine years. That's impossible. That's totally nonsense. Unless he was helped. Is that clear? Okay? So don't be so full yourself. Your progress actually is, your practice has a lot of help from a lot of good guys. We're on the good side of the fence, of the railroad tracks, okay? When you do this good thing here, you receive so much help, trust me. So Shen Kuang got help from Bodhidharma, because Bodhidharma would make sure that he was not, he would not quit, okay? And then for example, in the summertime it's very, very hot, okay, uh, and Shen Kuang was perspiring for example, and he said, "I can't take this much, I'm going to pass out in this heat," and all of a sudden, there's this light breeze. [Master Yong Hua blows gently] So the Dharma protectors would blow air, cool air, not hot air. Seriously, when you're hot, someone does this for you, it changes you, it gives you the kind of relief that's so much appreciated. So Shen Kuang had a lot of help, a lot of support, because not only Bodhidharma was helping him, the Dharma protectors around Venerable Bodhidharma were also assisting him, you know, in so many invisible ways. We on the good side guys, if you think that the demons are causing a lot of problems out there, I assure you the good guys are also helping us as well. Okay? That's what happened. That's the only way that this could have transpired, in my opinion. Lesson? Don't be so full of yourself. We're receiving a lot of help, a lot more help than we are aware of. Alright? Hm. So anyway, uh, hm, okay. And<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=8090">02:14:50</a> |  Why do we go into Da Hui Song? Or Zhong? Zhong, whatever, okay. So anyway, the main thing here, I don't know why we got into this, this, uh, this uh Da Hui here, okay, but the interesting point here, is that Venerable Bodhidharma transmitted the Sudden Teaching to Shen Kuang. Okay, and that is the seal behind the transmission from generation to generation. Somehow, they have to transmit the Sudden Teaching to the next generation, because that is the essence of Chan. That is the essence of Mahayana. I'm sorry Korean Sunims, Chan is not, it's not, uh, Seon is not, is not, uh, Hua Tou, okay? Seon is the Sudden Teaching. That's how you can tell whether you have real Chan or not. For example, in Japan, they don't have Sudden Teaching at all. There's no mention of it, yeah, from the documents I read in English. No mention of Sudden teaching. It's all about you knowing more Hinayana  aspects of Chan, of meditation. Alright? Uh,  anyway, I don't know why we had 43 here, this Da Hui here, uh, real Chan, real Chan is [uninteliigible] So, so, so,  after Venerable Bodhidharma taught Shen Kuang, okay, that special Sudden Teaching right there, Shen Kuang immediately became enlightened. That's how you transmit the Sudden Teaching. Then Bodhidharma recognized Shen Kuang, uh, was, was uh, was uh, was right there at the threshold, okay, and then,<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=8257">02:17:37</a> |  Shen Kuang who later became Hui Ke, uh,  said, "Uh, uh, now that my arm hurts," uh, and he says,  "My, my, I am troubled by the pain in my arm. Okay? Please help me calm my mind down." And Bodhidharma says, "Bring me your mind, I will calm it down for you," and Hui Ke says, "Uhh... I can't find my mind, how can I bring it to you?" okay, he said, "Then I pacify your mind." And is, and at that point Hui Ke, Hui Ke then crossed the threshold, and went into the world, the realm of Enlightenment.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=8305">02:18:25</a> |  Time is up? Oh my God, time is up. So sorry Korea. Uh. Okay? So we end here today, thank you all for coming. And I'm sorry I exceeded the time limit. Next time we continue 45 okay? Thank you. [Audience claps]<br/></p>
