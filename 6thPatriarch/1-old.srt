[Music]

23
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:47,330
hello everyone today is the 23rd october 2021
uh we gathered here to start discussing the

24
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:53,010
sixth patriarch sutra one of the

25
00:10:53,010 --> 00:11:03,110
most important document buddhist scripture
on the sudden teaching okay which is a distinctive

26
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:11,720
characteristics of the chan school of mahayana
all right so the full name is the six patriarchs

27
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,160
dharma jewel platform sutra okay

28
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:25,140
and on slide let's see we are redoing this
because we did this like four years ago four

29
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:34,170
plus years ago and when we first started for
our for over four years ago uh we uh my intention

30
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:40,120
was the honor of my late chinese teacher master
XuanHua and so who was hiding under his shadow

31
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:48,140
and tried to explain to simply try to elaborate
what he meant was my intention and now the

32
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:58,170
the condition change a little bit so now we
try to explain the sutra from the american

33
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:06,670
mahayana perspective instead of chinese mahayana
perspectives so uh that's why we we are uh

34
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:14,170
and we i we feel that it's worthwhile to do
it again and explain it in a way for people

35
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:24,430
in the 21st century especially western educated
people i'm not chinese but but i try i'm sort

36
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:32,470
of a hybrid person i try to bridge the gap
between the east eastern culture and the western

37
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:42,070
culture and luckily for us we have a lot of
very competent chinese speaking people as

38
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:50,560
well so and taiwanese as well no disrespect
intended to the taiwanese people

39
00:12:50,560 --> 00:13:03,800
so so it is a collaborative effort i i hope
you all pitch in and we will each other we

40
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,490
learn from each other and and make this a
richer and more rewarding experience in particular

41
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:18,630
this is a very auspicious because uh we also
have the korean audience as well korean is

42
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:25,019
a culture a buddhist culture that emphasizes
chan meditation in particular the HuaTou they

43
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:33,230
put a lot of emphasis on that and and so this
is a in a small way a liberal contribution

44
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:39,890
to their chain culture and they call seon
seon culture as well okay so welcome all of

45
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:48,040
you thank you very much okay god when you
get on your knees like that

46
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:57,500
is it me thank you all right like so uh six
uh that's uh jump right into it uh the sixth

47
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:04,279
patriarch is the six patriarch from a chinese
lineage the first patriarch was indian there's

48
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:11,430
a venerable great master Mahākāśyapa so
there is a first patriarch of the orthodox

49
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:19,899
line lineage of of orthodox buddhism so the
very important thing here we need to take

50
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:26,870
away from this is that this is uh where if
you want to learn buddhism if you want to

51
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:34,350
learn mahayana this is where you should go
and look for good teachers these patriarchs

52
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:40,000
all right so it started in india and then
eventually it was transferred from india to

53
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:49,540
china and and to via venerable great master
Bodhidharma and the 28th patriarch okay is

54
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:56,019
there a question on JMT or just my imagination
because the sign keeps on flashing that you

55
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:05,529
know or is it just uh malcolm who cannot decide
uh uh between uh uh seoul and and uh and and

56
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:18,889
JMT huh anyway is it you malcolm yeah i recognize
his flaming hair

57
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:24,430
yeah now today yesterday is that uh it's in
seoul and today is in at uh jewel mountain

58
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:34,750
temple yeah hello yeah the world traveler
[Laughter]

59
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:40,779
all right so so the venerable great master
bodhidharma brought the mahayana transferred

60
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:50,600
mahayana from india to china because that's
at the time that's where the next competent

61
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:57,750
students would be found this is a problem
with patriarch they need to go where the students

62
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:03,389
are so that they can teach them and train
them okay so at that time

63
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:12,550
venerable Bodhidharma had to go to india from
india to china he abandoned india his indian

64
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:21,470
disciples went cold turkey to china on his
own by himself no entourage okay and he went

65
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:33,500
there and and to transfer the indian mahayana
knowledge to the chinese uh the first patriarch

66
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:39,279
was so he became the first chinese patriarch
so he's like holding two hats indian patriarch

67
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:47,170
28th patriarch from india and first chinese
patriarch all right so and he transferred

68
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:59,080
it to the uh the second chinese patriarch
by the name of HuiKe okay so what did he transfer

69
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:12,160
they didn't quite say it but what he transferred
is had to be the sudden teaching mahayana

70
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:23,199
is about the sudden teaching if you don't
have sudden teaching you cannot teach mahayana

71
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,809
if you don't understand the sudden teaching
you cannot

72
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:32,520
really train the next generation at all

73
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:40,370
and that's a constraint and that's why uh
when we got to the sixth patriarch six chinese

74
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:49,190
patriarch we're in venerable HuiNeng okay
he was there around the 8th century a.d all

75
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,850
right so now it's light number four

76
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:04,450
in contrast if you look at the hinayana hierarchy
of buddhism then you have to you want to learn

77
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:15,140
hinayana then i have tremendous respect for
the thai people the thai buddhist system why

78
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:26,540
is that because they have a long history of
training people i met some of the recent the

79
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:36,049
recent head monks thai monks and they are
very good they are they are really uh pretty

80
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:43,010
good levels of arhats four-stage arhats and
therefore that system consistently passed

81
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:50,720
on that knowledge to the next generation this
is key to buddhism buddhism is about once

82
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,940
you have the knowledge once you have the wisdom
it is behooves upon you to pass it on the

83
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:06,570
next generation you cannot let it discontinue
at all so that knowledge about the sudden

84
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:16,470
teaching in mahayana must be passed on to
next generation okay and similarly in hinayana

85
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:23,630
they have a way of training people so that
they have a tremendous success they produce

86
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:31,169
a lot of four-stage arhats and probably pratyekabuddha
as well even though i haven't met any yet

87
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:37,900
okay so that's the distinctive characteristics
over there and

88
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:45,450
and uh uh so they have a lot of uh thai uh
uh jargon here they're they're big shots and

89
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:55,410
uh just between us uh don't say this don't
quote me okay among them are bodhisattvas

90
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:01,789
they're gonna be offended

91
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:11,190
i saw some of them are bodhisattvas okay you
know why it's important because the bodhisattvas

92
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:20,410
help defend them against the demonic perversion
in the system because they spot those things

93
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:26,450
and say no no no cut this off this is why
you call the doctor and cut off the limb this

94
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:39,770
is a bad limb cut it off cut it off okay otherwise
the system will be

95
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:47,820
what's the word Master XianJie

96
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,380
tainted what else

97
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,500
um i'm not sure what we're looking for right
now sorry

98
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,410
okay i'll

99
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,470
what is the more polite term for polluted

100
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:15,350
deteriorate it is too uh scholar scholarly

101
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:24,500
is it like corrupted corrupted thank you it's
very serious if you let corruption sneak in

102
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:31,929
that's the beginning of the end just like
speaking of uh governments and policy and

103
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:37,850
so forth you know we go to another country
and try to change government and change the

104
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:42,940
political system and all and you don't guard
against corruption in government that's it

105
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:49,929
it will never work never ever never happened
never work in vietnam for example okay never

106
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:55,170
work in any country as a matter of fact if
you have corruption in the system the system

107
00:21:55,170 --> 00:22:02,070
will fall so what happened never mind about
politics and you know uh so what happened

108
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:10,510
is that in the thai system they have bodhisattva
disguising themselves as our hearts and they

109
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:17,890
are not in power they only serve in advisory
roles and and and that's why the system is

110
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:23,260
so healthy so strong because of that reason
they have protection because if you leave

111
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:32,900
alone it alone to the arhats the arhats can
still be fooled okay so so that's why that's

112
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:41,039
why in terms of hinayana i highly recommend
you want to learn my hinayana thing go to

113
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:48,880
thailand i highly recommend it okay and they
have a council I know briefly about it i met

114
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,730
the head guy from thai council yeah he is
a forth stage arhat for sure

115
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:01,860
and and uh he has spiritual penetrations as
well and so forth okay so these people for

116
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:09,530
real folks they're worth the worthy of our
offerings okay i would not hesitate to make

117
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:19,910
offerings though okay yeah uh and uh the supreme
patriarch is uh this uh great monk here Rattanakosin

118
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:32,220
okay uh since 2017 and so forth look how young
he is yeah young looking he is okay and uh

119
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,250
all right so so that's the buddhism right
there if you want you are a believer in hinayana

120
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:44,659
okay and you say mahayana not for me go to
thailand i i don't care whoever you are okay

121
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:53,470
it's a it's a great place to learn yes sir
yellow

122
00:23:53,470 --> 00:24:01,309
be the more proper adjective corrupt yeah
corrupt yeah thank you thank you very much

123
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:10,950
all right i stand corrected i should be more
corrupt okay corrupted is is not quite correct

124
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:23,360
okay all right so so going back to our small
world of mahayana because in the west right

125
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:34,809
now Master XuanHua transmitted his knowledge
of the sudden teaching to this country already

126
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:43,010
okay meaning that the fact from a fresh from
a professional perspective the people here

127
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:50,020
are better recipients of that teaching then
the people back in his country as a fact okay

128
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:59,860
no disrespect intended for the taiwanese either
all right so so he had to go to this country

129
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:08,390
to the US to transfer the sudden teaching
dharma door okay so as americans here american

130
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:16,480
has no color skin color by the way as you
can look around you only hardly any white-color

131
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:23,200
skins here at all you see and that's a nature
of american buddhism american buddhism people

132
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,440
think american american is like you know it's
must be caucasian no american is a mixed you

133
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:37,799
know thing and and and uh and that's what
makes america superior in my in in my in my

134
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:44,420
mind is that the ability to absorb and embrace
everything that is the spirit mahayana right

135
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:53,299
there okay so he had to go to this country
master XuanHua okay brought this chinese mahayana

136
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:59,870
of the us in particular he brought the dharma
door of the sudden teaching okay sudden teaching

137
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:04,940
meaning that those of you who are not familiar
with this sudden teaching meaning that with

138
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:11,850
this teaching teaching meaning you have to
hear it you have to you have to someone has

139
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:20,650
to speak it okay okay and and with when you
hear this when you read this you can attain

140
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:32,522
enlightenment suddenly okay only in mahayana
can you have that okay and so this uh the

141
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:41,990
six patriarch taught this uh method of certain
enlightenment if you will okay and uh and

142
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:49,720
so uh this dharma door here actually has many
access access routes it leads to that door

143
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:59,409
called certain enlightenment but to get there
has many pathways if you will all right questions

144
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:09,570
this is very important this is a momentous
moment in china when my great master bodhidharma

145
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:17,900
went to china and decided ah i'm gonna teach
HuiKe great master HuiKe this sudden teaching

146
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:24,610
thing and then master HuiKe then transferred
it to the third patriarch who transferred

147
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:30,730
the fourth patriarch who transferred it to
the fifth patriarch master HongRen who then

148
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:37,049
transferred that sudden teaching to mastur
HuiNeng and we'll find out a little bit later

149
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:46,899
all right so this is very very important and
by the way okay as americans okay

150
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:52,470
the mindset should be that we should be grateful
to the chinese for this gift because you know

151
00:27:52,470 --> 00:28:00,660
it's a gift that will have tremendous consequences
for us our generation as well our children's

152
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:10,149
generation and further further down the road
as well okay this is very very critical heritage

153
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:19,880
that we we are we are leaving behind okay
so so that's why we uh since since master

154
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,429
XuanHua didn't really elaborate that much
about the sudden teaching when he taught this

155
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:34,520
in how long ago i don't remember the the anyone
knows he he taught this he explains the sutra

156
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:40,669
explain the six patriarch sutra is one of
the popular explanations out there for in

157
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:47,309
mahayana a lot of people buddhists and non-buddhists
like would read up on his books they find

158
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:57,380
it very very interesting very insightful and
but but he never really elaborated that much

159
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:04,260
on the sudden teaching which is what venerable
HuiNeng specialized in doing okay so we'll

160
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,530
dwell more on that side right number eight

161
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:21,110
uh and at the time at the time buddhism uh
was there in china already okay but just like

162
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:29,779
nowadays just like typically what happens
that that people studied books studied scriptures

163
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:38,700
and did ceremonies and so what it's called
very superficial cultivation okay substance

164
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:49,230
is what mahayana is about okay it's a it's
uh it's uh it's about uh the core your core

165
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:58,640
your heart it's not it's not about appearances
not about temples it's not about fame reputation

166
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,870
all right go ahead korea

167
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:27,850

170
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:52,659

it's uh it's a myth what actually happened

171
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:56,649
it sounded good but what should happen is
the chinese would like you to believe that

172
00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:06,420
he walked but it's not true actually what
happened is he boarded a boat he didn't swim

173
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:13,130
either

174
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:17,519
and then he walked to vietnam that's true

175
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:25,470
yeah monks couldn't couldn't uh couldn't ride
horses they can't they can't ride horses only

176
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:36,890

178
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:46,970
uh master this is more of a comment there's
a there's a rapper i listened to and he he

179
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:52,330
wrote a book and bodhidharma was mentioned
and he's he was that's where i got that from

180
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:58,760
he walked from india to china and um he actually
mentioned chan in the book and then that zen

181
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:06,429
came from chan like the japanese zen so i
thought that was pretty cool that he they

182
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:13,179
um this is kind of a rap song so it's a rapper
that got me into the um the asian culture

183
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:19,779
a long time ago yeah i hear right you you
listen to rap not as much anymore good for

184
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:25,510

certain things i just can't stand

185
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:37,039
just kidding just kidding all right very good
yes wei mountain oh god i always get in trouble

Huế definitely central vietnam

188
00:32:51,230 --> 00:33:04,600
no hesitation no doubt yes uh over here black
so it is the tradition story that bodhidharma

189
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:12,649
came to china um well actually while he was
trying in china he traveled well no sorry

190
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:18,400
i think when he came to china he um can buy
a piece of leaf and then no went across the

191
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:25,290
water right no no no no no no no you chinese
a nice try no no no no no no you're distorting

192
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:31,190
the fact you're china's china person no no
you can't you you can't sneak that in no no

193
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:39,700
no no no i think uh uh he boarded a boat i
think a viking boat yeah um it was it was

194
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:48,900
coded as an example of um you actually can
show um spiritual power as a chan master to

195
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:57,610
teach people when he was in china he did cross
a river on a leaf oh yeah see your chinese

196
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:03,410
history is so mixed i saw the indian ocean
i guess indian ocean is an ocean it's not

197
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:10,550
a river yeah yeah okay get your chinese facts
straight please all right yeah he did cross

198
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:18,030
actually that's very famous yeah there's there's
plenty of uh uh drawings of him on a leaf

199
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:26,110
yeah oh i think uh that's when uh they showed
up like yeah that's chinese he uh he came

200
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:31,050
from the north when after he talked with Emperor
Wu of Liang and then he pissed off the Emperor

201
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:36,730
Wu of Liang and then he left the northern
china to go to southern china i think that's

202
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:41,810
where the the story of the one leaf crossed
the river yeah he crossed a river and on on

203
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:49,360
a leaf that's true okay yeah and and uh not
clear on how what propelled him okay

204
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:58,790
all right but it's true that he did cross
water on a leaf that's pretty impressive okay

205
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:09,560
uh and uh and so so he was actually pretty
desperate looking for someone so anyone please

206
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,220
who wants to learn mahayana i know from me
take it off my hands okay the chinese no no

207
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:22,000
you're too black i mean your skin too dark
we don't trust you so you know so he really

208
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,880
struggled and finally he found a yellow soul
i mean a chinese soul who took it from him

209
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:36,099
okay and we're grateful for that my point
here is that in all due respect okay i personally

210
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:45,190
i'm grateful to chinese culture i feel it's
because because the when when great master

211
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:52,230
bodhidharma transferred the mahayana to china
he he really

212
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:59,530
the chinese buddhism that i learned mahayana
buddhism i learned is tremendous so profound

213
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:07,440
it's so beautiful so wonderful and it's a
gift to the world really you should transcend

214
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,760
the national barriers and and races and genders
and so forth because this buddhism here is

215
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,020
to me it's beauty it's just like you look
at a piece of art it's to me it's like that

216
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:27,600
you look at a statue Rodin or or what's a
guy who lost his ear cut his ear to give to

217
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:36,119
a prostitute girlfriend van gogh okay those
things are just beautiful i mean look at this

218
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,200
like wow yeah you know it

219
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:48,540
it makes you feel good in your heart you know
it's not the visual thing you look at that

220
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:55,920
yeah i mean it connects from that painting
to your heart directly okay through the stomach

221
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:04,810
but um yeah but so so i'm grateful i don't
know about you i'm so grateful that the chinese

222
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:10,390
buddhism because what we got from them what
i got from Master XuanHua is it's it's so

223
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:23,890
beautiful the first time my life after i learned
mahayana i said wow this is wonderfully beautiful

224
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:36,220
okay mahayana is helps you appreciate beauty
okay yes was there a question somewhere

225
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:45,240
master what is the meaning behind venerable
bodhidharma leaving on the leaf because this

226
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:54,510
has been thousands of years and there's a
lot of painting about it meeting him what

227
00:37:54,510 --> 00:38:03,359
leaving across the cross the river by one
piece of one leaf i have no idea okay when

228
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,310
i'm able to do that i will explain it to you

229
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,920
and don't hold your breath

230
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:19,030
okay uh you you vietnamese people weird you
know i'm just talking about the depth and

231
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:25,040
the beauty of mahayana he says let's go back
to floating on a leaf across the river what's

232
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:32,800
beautiful about that to me is it's a it's
indian show-off okay i'm we're talking about

233
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:42,390
beautiful chinese people chinese things okay
and taiwanese too yeah it's so difficult nowadays

234
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:52,150
you know to not offend one and and and please
the other uh anyway so anyway so this sutra

235
00:38:52,150 --> 00:39:00,550
here uh it's about it's about uh the emphasis
of this sutra here is actually uh about cultivation

236
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:07,700
in order to learn about the sudden teaching
here you need to grind it out first you need

237
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:14,800
to bear the discomfort and and keep grinding
and grinding and when you ready that's when

238
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:22,640
the sudden teaching is bestowed upon you and
boom you leap okay any questions okay and

239
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:31,130
and and uh this is a function the sudden teaching
is a function of the responsibility of the

240
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:40,089
great teachers and and in a way to be fair
uh master XuanHua did transmit the sudden

241
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:48,741
teaching to his disciples but low level sudden
teaching all right and you pay attention to

242
00:39:48,741 --> 00:39:54,849
how he explained the six patriarch suture
you find that yes there's some some illusions

243
00:39:54,849 --> 00:40:02,089
to a sudden teaching and when master XuanHua
explained it but he didn't really go into

244
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:08,480
greater depths so hopefully we add more to
it this is important because remember okay

245
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:19,690
what we what i call american mahayana is hardly
by the skin color okay look at us

246
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:30,790
the asians are taking over silicon valley
let's face it [Laughter] all right okay on

247
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,970
the koreans they have no sense of humor and
this is there

248
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:42,500
ah these poor koreans a long way to go

249
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:50,950
all right so jewel jewel is his dharma that
is precious and jewel is uh is when you hear

250
00:40:50,950 --> 00:41:00,680
jewel or gem that's a great value it's highly
desirable and it's so chinese to me to me

251
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:10,589
i would prefer first americans to look at
the beauty of the dharma the dharma is beautiful

252
00:41:10,589 --> 00:41:17,530
the dharma i assure you if you understand
the dharma you see the beauty what kind of

253
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:22,540
beauty uh estee lauder

254
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,310
lancome

255
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:35,050
no beauty of people's heart

256
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:46,569
the heart you cut it up can be very beautiful
when you look at it not with the knife

257
00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:55,650
okay people's heart when you get to recognize
you get to see them people's heart is so beautiful

258
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:03,750
and i yesterday i was playing with a kid a
kid naughty naughty kid okay and i it's amazing

259
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:09,310
i tell you this you know i was playing the
kid and i was teaching at the same time i

260
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:16,900
was teaching the kid about emotions and yesterday
he was playing and he tripped he fell on his

261
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:25,240
butt the right butt so he was he was gathering
himself up and touching his butt and was deciding

262
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:33,020
should i cry now or or what i'm entitled cry
am i not and he was as he was thinking i laughed

263
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:38,650
at him i made fun of him and he immediately
got the message and said i'm so this is so

264
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:45,380
embarrassing how could i fall like this he
hit behind he ran away and hit immediately

265
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:58,010
okay so so kids heart can be so beautiful
too you know anyway so the jewel here to me

266
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:03,880
it's not it's not the gem like a chinese people
would like the asians like to think you know

267
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:15,640
the indians are into gold chinese are into
jade okay girls are into diamonds i heard

268
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,310
and i'm into vajra

269
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:27,780
okay vajra is beautiful okay and and and but
but primarily you know the is the heart that

270
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:36,960
interests me about this mahayana here and
the heart here is is uh uh the heart of mahayana

271
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:46,540
the heart of master HuiNeng in particular
is precious it's rare and to me it's sublime

272
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,390
all right

273
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,390
platform

274
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:58,109
apparently on slide number 10 platform is
where the place where the sutra is spoken

275
00:43:58,109 --> 00:44:06,290
is NanHua okay in that famous temple there
and they build a platform like here uh about

276
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:14,970
10 feet uh Wontek Sunim how tall is this when
you build this you remember how tall is this

277
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:23,150
not even 31 inches

278
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:30,990
okay and uh and the platform is a is a place
a revere place pure place where they did important

279
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:37,349
things in buddhism they transmit the precept
substance from the heart from master to your

280
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:44,339
heart that's what it happens and then they
speak the dharma to shape the heart okay and

281
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:46,810
that's called buddhist plastic surgery

282
00:44:46,810 --> 00:45:00,900
all right seriously they they knew about plastic
surgery back then already uh all right 11.

283
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:13,470
sutra is anything that's spoken by the buddha
to teach us about cultivation and and and

284
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:25,619
sutra here has a meaning like to attract it's
a it's a it's the logic the uh beauty of the

285
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:33,550
teaching you know the uh the superior intellect
the superior wisdom is very attractive to

286
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:41,809
most of us and it's a and and it's designed
to give us directions on how to

287
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:51,309
what? the chinese like to say to cultivate
i don't think of cultivation i'm thinking

288
00:45:51,309 --> 00:45:58,130
sutra is teaching us how to live our lives
to the fullest whether you're a left home

289
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:05,410
person or a lay person okay sutras are supposed
to do that supposed to teach us how to live

290
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:14,250
okay be happier our lives okay and when you're
happy okay you share it with your family you

291
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:24,510
share it with your students you share your
co-workers okay and uh in particular this

292
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:33,670
way of practice here is in accord or consistent
with the intent of the buddhas and the wisdom

293
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:43,980
of the buddhas all right so this sutra here
is very special because because it is um it

294
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:50,309
is the first time in chinese buddhism and
i don't know it happened in indian buddhism

295
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:57,520
or not but in chinese buddhism buddhism is
the only time that the sutra was uh recorded

296
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:07,430
and the teaching was recorded and classified
as a sutra when it was spoken by a chinese

297
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:17,180
monk not the buddha okay so it's very very
special it's really a a a treasure to the

298
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,380
chinese

299
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:27,940
okay so we should be grateful here in our
era us here in this country that we're able

300
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:37,500
to receive this as a gift from the chinese
okay you need to give credit where it's do

301
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:43,059
so we need to be good to be grateful to the
chinese uh

302
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:51,640
kindness and generosity via master XuanHua
okay all right at least i am grateful i don't

303
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:59,650
know about you okay so when he is explaining
sutras we go through the TianTai school for

304
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:06,300
general analysis to give us an overview what
to expect from the sutra so explain the names

305
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:15,770
uh and and uh according to that the TianTai
school the sutra is by the title it refers

306
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:24,300
to a person and a dharma analogy and a place
and so forth uh blah blah blah you know you

307
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:29,349
can you can look it up i'm i'm not interested
in these things uh it's too TianTai for me

308
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:35,220
and discriminating is the substance uh it's
talked about real mark as substance and the

309
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:43,240
real mark here is a very advanced concept
for enlightened people and this is the distinctive

310
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:51,480
characteristics for chinese buddhism okay
real mark is is by definition real mark is

311
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,970
no mark but uh but nothing is without mark
okay

312
00:48:55,970 --> 00:49:06,020
實相無相無不相 is the chinese thing
i memorized couldn't understand it 25 years

313
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:13,480
ago okay that's all you have to do memorize
it no mark but nothing without mark that is

314
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:22,190
real mark all right yes yellow master just
a quick question is it possible that the sixth

315
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:31,180
patriarch is a reincarnation of shakyamuni
buddha no he's vietnamese

316
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:36,930
i'm glad you asked

317
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:43,300
we hear this a lot you know my late vietnamese
master said you know i have proof i written

318
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:47,970
a book on how the six patriarch is vietnamese

319
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:56,440
i say oh i know you want to live in your temple
so i'm not going to disagree with you [Laughter]

320
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:09,829
uh it's so easy reincarnation in the buddha
my in my humble opinion i feel he's a buddha

321
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:16,931
okay because his depth he's my teacher is
chinese and he's he's his level is very very

322
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:21,099
high okay but

323
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:27,030
when you look at his teachings the way he
taught his disciples see i'm he knew and he

324
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:33,400
taught me three times directly in person and
the other time is like i hear you know i go

325
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,310
crazy like flaming hair

326
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:38,940
ah yeah there we go again

327
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:48,329
we wouldn't believe it yesterday i was talk
that taught me about five six different emotions

328
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:49,560
he became just like that

329
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:59,829
oh no now he has a companion

330
00:50:59,829 --> 00:51:07,559
all right so uh so easy is he a buddha i feel
that he's a buddha because the teaching is

331
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:16,550
so profound so so beautiful you will

332
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:23,050
okay but i don't think he is shakyamuni buddha
at all okay uh because that would be a bad

333
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:29,230
president and the buddha came he left and
he came back again say what he has nothing

334
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:35,450
else to do i mean it's like if you leave please
go don't don't come back to me it's just like

335
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:42,420
doesn't make sense there's no point being
so sticky and the buddha come and go and and

336
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:48,450
let the next buddha come give them a chance
you know so you know you guys are too sticky

337
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:53,000
no no i i hope it's not shakyamuni buddha
but i don't know because you asked me about

338
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:59,880
state of buddha wrong person to ask okay ask
something i know not something i don't know

339
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:12,440
okay what is the principle here okay uh to
become a buddha all of us can become a buddha

340
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:27,110
okay message don't sell yourself short no
discrimination okay so that's uh uh it's it's

341
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:35,190
uh anyone can become a buddha that's why no
that's why that's why now is our chance okay

342
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:42,599
we don't have to go to china anymore although
you know you want to learn tai chi i still

343
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:49,900
feel we need still need to go to china wudang
okay i will go to wudang for about a year

344
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:57,369
too i would love to go there and learn you
know i hear speaking of walking on leaves

345
00:52:57,369 --> 00:53:07,369
i hear they walk on walls i saw a demonstration
he actually walked on walls i was so impressed

346
00:53:07,369 --> 00:53:11,530
i said wow

347
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:21,170
anyway yeah so you can realize realize buddhahood
you can all of us can okay no one is exempt

348
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:26,230
even the lady back there who's half asleep
she can too the sudden teaching is that we

349
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:31,310
can all become a buddha just like that that
she must have to cross her legs

350
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:38,849
just kidding

351
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:43,099
it's a requirement you think it's free you
know we have to work for it and the function

352
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:49,880
is to understand the mind and see your own
nature here understanding the mind is very

353
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:56,430
interesting you get to see how mind works
your mind how your mind works and once you

354
00:53:56,430 --> 00:54:07,530
understand how your mind works you begin to
be able to see how Yin's minds work you see

355
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:16,940
all right and the teaching mark is uh oh god
it's so scholarly sutra like sweet do heavenly

356
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:24,260
elixir immortality yeah so chinese i don't
like these concepts because it makes you greedy

357
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:38,339
you know it's like makes you so special i'm
i'm listening to six patriarch sutra hello

358
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:41,510
mama from china

359
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:50,630
[Laughter] i'm glad you made it the last time
i saw you in wei mountain temple

360
00:54:50,630 --> 00:55:01,569
[Music]

361
00:55:01,569 --> 00:55:13,910
so so this uh this uh not only is beautiful
but it's very tasty you can taste you know

362
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:19,890
that has to be real when you listen the sutra
and so every now and then you might get to

363
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:24,950
the state where actually when you swallow
your saliva it's kind of sweet that's a sweet

364
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:36,550
dew right there it happens all right and and
teaching period is uh is uh uh this uh happened

365
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:44,780
during the flower uh dharma flower or Lotus-Nirvana
period and then so forth okay all right any

366
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:51,280
questions i'm not as you have noticed by now
i'm not interested in scholarly thing i'm

367
00:55:51,280 --> 00:56:00,800
just like this raw and uh and uh

368
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:06,990
limited person i'm more interested in something
that that uh that's a beautiful tasty and

369
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:13,330
that kind of thing you will have my interest
but scholarly things i leave it to the phd

370
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:21,580
people all right um five chinese patriarchs
okay now you should uh be you should know

371
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:29,730
about okay that's how uh chinese buddhism
uh started to take root in china this is important

372
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:37,270
because we need to know for our generation
how are we going to make these american mahayana

373
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:43,790
take root okay we are right now i'm my second
generation you're a third generation so therefore

374
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:51,190
it helps to go back to how it happened in
china okay because we learned from a chinese

375
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:55,069
anyway

376
00:56:55,069 --> 00:57:04,540
and so it's uh it's set from the uh song of
enlightment another famous chinese uh creation

377
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:13,220
by the seventh patriarch that he recognized
bodhidharma was a 28th patriarch okay in that

378
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:25,780
proper or orthodox line of mahayana buddhism
okay and and all the indian prior patriarchs

379
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:39,390
from 1 to 27 followed bodhidharmas to he brought
all that indian heritage from india to china

380
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:47,630
and conferred upon the chinese so the chinese
inherited all the indian wisdom okay and that's

381
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:55,740
what is meant by transmitting the wisdom from
india to china okay it became chinese the

382
00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:05,030
chinese became the guardian of the indian
wisdom and and and later on after six patriarch

383
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:11,910
the chinese buddhism later on really really
prospered and blossomed they produce many

384
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:22,299
great talents many great patriarchs that i
feel that for us in our era our times we should

385
00:58:22,299 --> 00:58:29,830
spend the time to learn chinese and study
these great chinese teachers because the depth

386
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:37,000
of mahayana i keep on telling you this is
in the chinese language not in english yet

387
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:44,000
okay so if you want mahayana wisdom deeper
wisdom higher level wisdom you have to learn

388
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,250
chinese okay

389
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:52,780
any questions about that so you know where
to find look for materials and where to look

390
00:58:52,780 --> 00:59:01,480
where to look for in terms of great teachers
it's not you know the uh the chinese teachings

391
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:09,400
patriarch teachings actually much higher level
than here

392
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:15,880
that's available in english that's a fact
okay so for you those of you out there who

393
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:22,190
feel that you understand mahayana i strongly
urge you to learn chinese because you should

394
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:29,819
go back to the chinese teachers okay and in
the future i hope you transfer translate that

395
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:38,010
teaching from chinese into english okay in
order to do that you have to learn chan chan

396
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:45,650
is a requirement okay without chan you cannot
have the proper translation and you find in

397
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:54,760
the sutra that we use an old version of my
master's disciples translation and it has

398
00:59:54,760 --> 01:00:06,539
quite a few things that missed the mark completely
okay and so there are there are some significant

399
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:13,470
patriarchs Mahākāśyapa don't have much
teaching of him Ananda and then the second

400
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:19,950
patriarch fourteen patriarch very famous they
were Nagarjuna

401
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:23,430
Nagarjuna how how do you say it have flaming
hair

402
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:36,240
wow

403
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:52,530
master i don't know but um not what naga una
[Music]

404
01:00:52,530 --> 01:01:02,549
okay and and then an uh Nagarjuna and then
uh Vasubandu is another famous uh uh famous

405
01:01:02,549 --> 01:01:12,210
indian patriarch next 15. uh bodhidharma we're
talking about bodhidharma he is a prince in

406
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:21,569
of a kingdom in southern india king is very
devout buddhist it shows right there if

407
01:01:21,569 --> 01:01:27,069
your parents are buddhists

408
01:01:27,069 --> 01:01:31,780
then you're bestowing great blessings to your
children

409
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:43,280
because you give them exposure to the teaching
of wisdom

410
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:51,730
okay so so the conventional wisdom is that
is that when you're born into a family as

411
01:01:51,730 --> 01:02:00,250
buddhist you are incredibly blessed if you
will all

412
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:12,480
uh of course there're always exceptions

413
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:21,970
but not only was uh the king was a buddhist
he is a devout buddhist and and he made uh

414
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:31,670
offerings to the patriarch so he have access
to the 27th patriarch okay and he gave a priceless

415
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:42,819
pearl to patriarch okay lesson number two
you have to make offerings to the patriarchs

416
01:02:42,819 --> 01:02:50,619
to the great teachers okay so this king here
not only was he devout devoted to buddhism

417
01:02:50,619 --> 01:02:57,840
meaning he helped propagate buddhism he also
made a lot of offerings supported the great

418
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:12,190
teachers the patriarchs okay and because of
that his children have tremendous blessings

419
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:19,800
okay and so this is very special family so
when he offered priceless pearl to the 27th

420
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:25,829
indian patriarch he showed the pearl the patriarch
showed the pearl to the three princes son

421
01:03:25,829 --> 01:03:35,160
of the king and asked anything more valuable
in this pearl that i just received and the

422
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:43,100
the two older princes said uh pearl is the
most precious in our kingdom and there's nothing

423
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:51,039
better in the world i'm very proud of it 16.
the third prince the youngest one was bodhidharma

424
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,970
which later became bodhidharma said this was
worldly pearl

425
01:03:54,970 --> 01:04:10,549
is not the most precious thing it is among
all the gems in the world the truth

426
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:17,150
is the supreme jewel okay

427
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:28,960
so indian okay but but back then as a young
prince he had he valued the truth already

428
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:38,809
okay he felt the truth was a treasure that
that that you that should be cherished not

429
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:44,529
not gems and jewels okay and the prince

430
01:04:44,529 --> 01:04:58,809
continues he says this this worldly luster
cannot be considered the finest okay the light

431
01:04:58,809 --> 01:05:05,099
the the brightness the light that's most precious
is uh from the light of wisdom

432
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:21,430
and uh the pearl even though uh has uh lucidity
but the lucidity of the mind is is the most

433
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:33,710
desirable okay so uh the young prince uh answer
is uh is uh really outstanding and so so the

434
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:41,490
it showed that this this young man here had
potential to be taught okay and that's what

435
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:49,900
great teachers recognize they recognize people
say who can be taught who would be worthy

436
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:53,230
of my efforts

437
01:05:53,230 --> 01:06:03,059
yes go ahead yellow master regarding the pronunciation
of Nagarjuna anthony heard from a disciple

438
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:04,770
it's pronounced Nagarjuna

439
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:12,020
that's what i heard from one of your disciples
i think yeah yeah i remember vaguely i just

440
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:20,140
cannot remember which uh which syllable to
put the inflection on so i thought it was

441
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:24,900
from flaming hair but it's not it's from someone
else yeah i think it's from someone else yeah

442
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:28,440
yeah someone else it's clearly not flaming
hair flaming hair is still

443
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:44,390
uh all right um and uh uh and uh and uh bodhidharma
said a lot of things that you know indians

444
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:52,809
they they're wordy and they they talk too
much

445
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:59,790
you know from a child perspective if i were
the 27th patriarch which i'm not i said you

446
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:10,440
talk too much boy uh uh so anyway it it clearly
this this young prince here is a has a special

447
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:19,920
mind he's not impressed by worldly things
okay and it comes with it comes with prior

448
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:31,859
blessings if you will if your children have
blessings they be drawn to thing of wisdom

449
01:07:31,859 --> 01:07:36,279
okay instead of they will not be impressed
by the size of the temple

450
01:07:36,279 --> 01:07:43,359
if i could influence you a little bit

451
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:52,390
we're not like uh the kings who has palaces
and three princes and so forth you know and

452
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:59,510
and so forth what we have is big hearts

453
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:07,180
okay so uh not i'm not interested in what
the young bodhidharma had to say to his teacher

454
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:12,369
he's not enlightened back then so it's a lot
of nonsense okay but somehow the indians were

455
01:08:12,369 --> 01:08:19,179
impressed the chinese were impressed so they
they they put this down okay uh to me it's

456
01:08:19,179 --> 01:08:27,540
too wordy it's too many words okay it's not
chan like and later he became better okay

457
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:38,450
so after the king father's death the young
prince became disciple and uh and and became

458
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:46,420
a monk okay so you see uh that's right there
again the behavior this person is similar

459
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:55,489
to the buddhas gautama buddhas where he uh
he was not uh impressed by worldly things

460
01:08:55,489 --> 01:09:04,170
by luxury by the uh the uh worldly pleasures
okay he he he

461
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:11,759
followed his teacher

462
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:21,170
and he served his teacher for 40 years until
he died okay another another another fact

463
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:31,561
about great bodhidharma is that he serves
his teacher okay and and and that's one of

464
01:09:31,561 --> 01:09:40,100
the most beautiful things you can do to show
gratitude okay he showed the reason he's a

465
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:50,440
prince remember he he's used to being treated
like the potential future king future emperor

466
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:56,730
therefore he's supposed to be uh idolized
and so forth but no he revered his teacher

467
01:09:56,730 --> 01:10:01,890
and became among to serve him

468
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:09,840
for 40 years that's very very impressive okay
and to me there is no

469
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:18,890
higher way better way to express gratitude
by taking care of your teacher okay i'm a

470
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:27,900
a great teacher like him and and and that's
one thing there that you can learn to spot

471
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:36,650
children or people okay okay the common denominator
of these great people is that they know gratitude

472
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:48,570
it comes from the heart your heart is big
you your heart is full of gratitude you don't

473
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:56,719
always have to take okay you can give

474
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:02,520
okay you give back to the people that

475
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:06,929
did you great favors

476
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:15,580
like your teacher like your parents like your
ancestors and so forth okay that's what uh

477
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:24,810
what uh what's special about the asian culture
okay you teach gratitude by being grateful

478
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:33,330
not not by talking about it okay and so boddidharma
served his master for 40 years that's very

479
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:46,719
impressive okay until his master died and
and his master asked him to go to china to

480
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:58,041
uh bring mahayana from india to china so basically
named him as a 28th patriarch okay and when

481
01:11:58,041 --> 01:12:07,540
he came there didn't speak chinese at all
so the chinese were very discriminatory and

482
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:13,730
look at him and say your skin is too black
and you two your beard you have a huge beard

483
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:26,010
and you uh so they look down upon this scornful
towards uh venerable bodhidharma okay uh don't

484
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:35,130
know why the chinese would draw bodhidharma
bare chested with a lot of hair do indians

485
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:45,210
have a lot of hair or not chest hair they
do i never know that

486
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:52,880
watch the movies [Laughter] no we're not watching
the same movies is there a lot of dancing

487
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,140
like

488
01:12:55,140 --> 01:13:11,420
i know you you they're talking all sudden
the man breaks down to dance and singing

489
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:12,699
anyway hairy chest

490
01:13:12,699 --> 01:13:28,840
why why you would draw him like that anyway
and then 21 he met with emperor the emperor

491
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:35,020
of the liang dynasty emperor wu this is a
very famous interchange okay hey it's funny

492
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:39,840
how children so many children here today who
are listening about these words of wisdom

493
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:50,550
and have no clue what we're talking about
[Laughter] it's fantastic it's called brainwashing

494
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:54,820
you know that it's called buddhist brain washing
you bring us here we put on you you can do

495
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:59,220
the same thing at home by the way turn on
the the tapes and and let them you let them

496
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:06,179
play while they listen to all this thing we
we talk about it's called brainwashing in

497
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:14,699
the future we come they become you know uh
a monk and uh with uh uh patriarch as well

498
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:23,850
so emperor wu who is uh who prided himself
on being knowledge about buddhism he spoke

499
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:32,220
to him he said through an interpreter of course
and who is that interpreter is probably in

500
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:40,540
my humble opinion in my opinion she's that
interpret probably an ancestor our our uh

501
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:42,750
precious Zhihong

502
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:53,010
or you don't know Zhihong it doesn't matter
okay so emperor wu says uh in my entire life

503
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:59,110
i help a lot of monks and nuns become monks
and nuns because when you become monk or nun

504
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:04,280
you need to have clothing proper clothing
so he paid for the clothing for the bowls

505
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:10,450
for the shoes and so forth okay and he built
monasteries for them so they say i've done

506
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:18,980
all those and have a lot of sutras copied
okay and created a lot of buddha images okay

507
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:28,340
and how how much merit did i earn okay Bodhidharma
says none

508
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:39,150
and it says good deeds done with with with
greed worldly intent okay i would translate

509
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:49,350
it as greed okay he did all those to impress
people

510
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:57,850
okay when you do good deeds to impress others
it's it's called worldly intent is self-serving

511
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:05,530
in other words okay and so you're greedy for
recognition in other words you greedy for

512
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:17,560
rewards okay that's the wrong way to do good
deeds you should do good deeds because

513
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:24,239
because there's a chance to do it that's all
when we have the chance to do something good

514
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:34,690
just do it and then forget it okay uh that's
all and and uh so bodhidharma said you did

515
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:44,250
a good deed but you bring good karma but no
merit okay and the emperor

516
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:50,699
then pursued he says what is the highest meaning
so he he he didn't like it so he changed the

517
01:16:50,699 --> 01:16:57,800
topic you see emperor's most convenient actually
after he heard the first answer it says no

518
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:06,770
merit whatsoever he says you just lost an
ear boy i mean indian guy

519
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:12,380
so he said okay but i'm going to be civil
he's a patriarch supposedly so i can be i'm

520
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:18,710
an emperor so i need to show my civil side
so he said he changed the subject i said what

521
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:24,969
is what he said what is the highest meaning
of the noble truth okay see it's very well

522
01:17:24,969 --> 01:17:34,690
read bodhidharma says there's no there's no
no noble truth there's only emptiness okay

523
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:38,909
Bodhidharma by then was a little bit

524
01:17:38,909 --> 01:17:44,590
cautious because he could tell that the emperor
was not happy with him and there's no point

525
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:49,820
in offending him and more than he needs to
he needed to so he said there's no noble truth

526
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:56,520
there's only emptiness actually he could have
said from a chan perspective what is the highest

527
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:00,530
meaning or noble truth

528
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:08,480
he could have said nothing but no he said
there's no noble truth there's only emptiness

529
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:18,630
so you can tell he's scared 23 and then the
emperor again was stumped he said i can't

530
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:26,780
pursue this so let's give him another one
last chance who's standing before me okay

531
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:34,010
meaning 朕 朕 is chinese for i'm better
than you you see he says i'm better than you

532
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:39,469
i'm i'm nobility and you are

533
01:18:39,469 --> 01:18:43,550
black um

534
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:53,409
dark skinned i mean and the bodhidharma says
i know not your majesty okay

535
01:18:53,409 --> 01:19:06,810
i know not the proper translation should be
changed to i cannot tell

536
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:13,469
Master XianJie don't just sit there do something

537
01:19:13,469 --> 01:19:24,110
i cannot tell you see the the immediate answer
is so beautiful he says uh i said it says

538
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:40,480
who's in front of me can you try change it
please who's in front of me okay who's facing

539
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,480
me

540
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:52,010
either one

541
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:57,679
okay

542
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:06,400
and so the brutal answer from from bodhidharma
he meant in english is

543
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:21,090
i can't tell

544
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:31,080
all right so after that the emperor gave up
and uh he said uh excuse me i need to go take

545
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:37,139
this phone call here

546
01:20:37,139 --> 01:20:41,639
from russia

547
01:20:41,639 --> 01:20:49,070
and so later he had an advisor would you believe
it's ZhiGong ZhiGong is one of the of the

548
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:57,510
wisest chinese monks and what does he do advising
this kind of emperor oh my goodness i when

549
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:04,800
i got to this point here i lost all respect
for ZhiGong

550
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:10,199
because if you hang around this person he
was thirsty for power recognition agreed he

551
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:21,810
was so greedy okay the only way that you can
help is yourself

552
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:29,210
because that's how he sees you okay if ZhiGong
is a true patriarch a great the person wisdom

553
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:36,590
is that i'm sorry your master okay i'm not
worthy of your patronage here's uh the master

554
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:41,060
at the DRBA go go there

555
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:48,400
okay yeah so uh i i it's a personal thing
for me because i know i was growing up i mean

556
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:55,760
when i was learning the way uh master XuanHua
spoke so highly of master ZhiGong he had spiritual

557
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:01,330
powers and so forth when he got to this point
here i said what are you doing advising this

558
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:08,219
emperor so he's this way because you advise
him

559
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:15,010
so he's your creation he's a product of your
training right so i would run uh okay that's

560
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:24,239
why ZhiGong is you know out uh so ZhiGong
says your highness still don't recognize this

561
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,239
person

562
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:42,420
so you don't recognize this person okay and
the emperor says uh i don't and ZhiGong says

563
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:51,469
this is GuanYin transmitting a buddha's mind
seal

564
01:22:51,469 --> 01:23:00,500
okay so ZhiGong says bodhidharma actually
is guan yin

565
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,920
so clearly GuanYin has nothing else to do

566
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:13,620
but we we have so many bodhisattvas and GuanYin
says let me bring mahayana from india to china

567
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:20,020
you the rest you can go on vacation go to
the bahamas or you take a hike you know something

568
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:25,130
let me do it for you so the rest of bodhisattvas

569
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:32,080
so we don't get a chance to create blessings
for ourselves okay so i don't know about this

570
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:42,699
ZhiGong guy here okay yeah it all due respect
to the chinese and taiwanese people

571
01:23:42,699 --> 01:23:51,420
and um and so the the emperor heard that this
is a sage so he was he he uh he had second

572
01:23:51,420 --> 01:24:01,850
thoughts and tried to uh send his uh uh his
boy to ask the venerable bodhidharma to backtrack

573
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:05,170
and come back so that he can make offerings
and support him

574
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:23,750
and and ZhiGong says no don't bother uh uh
even if uh uh uh even if the entire nation

575
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:33,159
goes all our people go okay he uh still wouldn't
come back

576
01:24:33,159 --> 01:24:43,139
okay so he says [CHinese] and she says even
if

577
01:24:43,139 --> 01:24:49,679
we all go okay

578
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:56,700
he still would not will not come back not
return would come back all right and so this

579
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:04,710
is a story of a transmission from india mahayana
from India to china so when venerable Bodhidharama

580
01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:13,469
went to nanjing listen speak dharma and back
then is typical as difficult as it is nowadays

581
01:25:13,469 --> 01:25:26,480
people speak dharma without wisdom they spoke
words they didn't they didn't teach from the

582
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:37,830
wisdom but from regurgitating the the the
technical jargon but even doing even for just

583
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:47,000
doing so the heavens the rain fragrant blossoms
and golden petals lotus rose from earth okay

584
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:54,240
and so he's uh he's a extraordinary dharma
master to the point where the heavens were

585
01:25:54,240 --> 01:26:02,810
making offerings to him and so bodhidharma
stopped by listened to his lecture and waited

586
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:12,989
for everyone to leave and cornered dharma
master of ShenGuang and asked him what what

587
01:26:12,989 --> 01:26:16,880
are you doing ShenGuang says i am explaining
sutras can't you tell

588
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:28,920
and i said why are you explaining the sutras
he said the answer is uh to teach people to

589
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:36,180
end birth and death and bodhidharma says how
does it happen okay the words are black and

590
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:45,940
white how does black and white you know things
can end birth and death and ShenGuang couldn't

591
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:53,239
have an answer and this is a lesson i learned
do not offend the chinese patriarchs the the

592
01:26:53,239 --> 01:26:58,650
chinese the chinese dharma masters okay it's
okay for you to offend me because i'm not

593
01:26:58,650 --> 01:27:09,239
chinese but but this is a common protocol
in that you don't you don't ask questions

594
01:27:09,239 --> 01:27:16,949
that that dharma masters cannot answer okay
please

595
01:27:16,949 --> 01:27:23,369
and uh but ShenGuang is a little bit have
a little bit of temp uh temper he got very

596
01:27:23,369 --> 01:27:32,010
upset and he whipped out his beads uh made
of steels okay and whacked them he says these

597
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:39,070
are the words of the demons and broke the
two front tooth so bodhidharma has a new nickname

598
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:40,070
leon [?]

599
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:53,030
yeah

600
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:57,130
so uh

601
01:27:57,130 --> 01:28:02,840
you know so whack him and say you are the
demon how dare you embarrass me how you say

602
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:08,869
demon's work you're doing demons yeah and
and so he broke his teeth because bodhidharma

603
01:28:08,869 --> 01:28:17,000
didn't dodge at all i remember and to this
point i remember that video of president bush

604
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:23,040
the small one when he went to afghanistan
someone threw a shoe at him

605
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:31,679
he went like this he knocked and he ducked
in a funny way too

606
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:40,510
but bodhidharma is like a true indian patriarch

607
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:47,389
stood there and lost two teeth

608
01:28:47,389 --> 01:28:53,440
i hope he gets good dentist

609
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:59,219
can you imagine we speak dharma and then as
we smile and the front of our mouth is black

610
01:28:59,219 --> 01:29:04,159
oh yeah yeah

611
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:07,889
what was he thinking

612
01:29:07,889 --> 01:29:16,880
i would have ducked myself like little bush
and uh Bodhidharma apparently according to

613
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:24,280
chinese the chinese wisdom he says there's
a legend where it sage's tooth fall to the

614
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:34,179
earth it would not rain for three years that's
probably what happened here in california

615
01:29:34,179 --> 01:29:41,719
and so bodhidharma says that would harm a
lot of people so i better take the pain and

616
01:29:41,719 --> 01:29:49,380
suffering instead of letting bad things happen
to the chinese people although they deserve

617
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:56,580
it so uh so the tooth fell out and so he swallowed
it okay

618
01:29:56,580 --> 01:30:07,920
and then he went away okay and then and then
uh according to master XuanHua yes did you

619
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:17,210
have a comment black white red

620
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:23,150
that video person audio person he sees like
in a trance

621
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:32,790
yeah right yeah so my question is by swallowing
the teeth that it solves the problem so it

622
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:38,170
will rain for three years or it solved that
problem or no it wouldn't rain for three years

623
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:42,960
for that the the dragon's intervention

624
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:52,230
but uh at least there won't be a a drought
for three years because it would if if he

625
01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:57,770
let the tooth the teeth fell fall to the ground
they would have a drought for three years

626
01:30:57,770 --> 01:31:09,580
there would be no drought for next because
of that okay so uh

627
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:19,239
so uh 
he swallowed them and disappeared okay and

628
01:31:19,239 --> 01:31:26,880
and uh and and uh so according to Master XuanHua
i remember this part master XuanHua then said

629
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:34,239
uh immediately right after that and you know
please take a grain of salt you know he's

630
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:42,350
not here so we don't know if i i there's lots
of things folks i wish i were there because

631
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:49,430
i have so many questions uh i'm not like a
typical american who are you know very afraid

632
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:56,290
of master XuanHua i would ask him uh great
master really i mean i hit the thing and all

633
01:31:56,290 --> 01:32:05,880
of a sudden the venerable ShenGuang was supposed
to die right away do you buy that or not i

634
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:15,170
find it's too much a coincidence what's the
rationale for that you believe or not when

635
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:17,920
i read that story i said seriously

636
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:27,420
you hit someone and broke two tooth i mean
leon spins never you know killed anyone because

637
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:32,440
of that no one died because of that

638
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:43,850
but there is a point to this story why did
he die immediately because he inflicted harm

639
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:55,409
on a great great sage supposedly GuanYin according
to ZhiGong which i respectfully disagree okay

640
01:32:55,409 --> 01:33:03,610
GuanYin would never fight with the bodhisattvas
would not compete for for blessings from bodhisattvas

641
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:14,400
i assure you okay we have so many great bodhisattvas
who are waiting for craving to bring mayana

642
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:20,460
from india to china why would GuanYin bodhisattva

643
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:30,420
steal those very virtues from them think about
it it just didn't make sense to me okay anyway

644
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:38,420
so what happened is this monk here

645
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:46,560
this uh this uh this uh this monk here ShenGuang
okay

646
01:33:46,560 --> 01:34:00,070
injured a great sage for that mere factor
he supposed to fall to the avicii hell the

647
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:08,659
worst hells there is just for that that's
how serious it is okay and therefore

648
01:34:08,659 --> 01:34:17,420
it's perfectly reasonable to say that he's
supposed to die right away because you know

649
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:23,880
how how big of a name bodhidharma was then
he deserves to die immediately because it's

650
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:28,909
very serious offense so

651
01:34:28,909 --> 01:34:35,440
so he's supposed to die so two ghosts came
and said our boss king yama would like to

652
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:43,469
have a word with you which is the you know
the the underworld uh word for okay it's time

653
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:52,350
for you to go okay and bodhidharma said uh
no the ShenGuang says why i'm so young in

654
01:34:52,350 --> 01:35:00,090
a prime of my life you know can i have some
more time he said nope your time is up just

655
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:04,290
like that i say yep

656
01:35:04,290 --> 01:35:12,300
so so ShenGuang says what did i do what did
i do and he said you don't know you broke

657
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:20,840
the two front teeth of a great sage that's
why and so ShenGuang says

658
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:29,429
oh i didn't know if i knew i would have not
done it the ghost says not my problem

659
01:35:29,429 --> 01:35:40,760
okay let's go and uh and ShenGuang got on
his knees i think and then begged to the ghost

660
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:44,690
says look at me i'm the dharma master you're
the ghost i'm beg to you give me some time

661
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:49,800
so that i uh learned from this monk a little
bit so that my life would not have been in

662
01:35:49,800 --> 01:36:01,560
vain okay and and so the ghosts must be high-ranking
ghosts it says okay i'm not seeing that you

663
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:07,960
are sincere i allow you a little bit of time
go and look for that monk and and uh and uh

664
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:17,460
do you think we'll wait a little bit for you
and so ShenGuang ran after after bodhidharma

665
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:26,860
by that time okay bodhidharma was walking
towards the south yes he went south is it

666
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:28,690
sound

667
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:34,900
no that sixth patriarch you confused

668
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:39,190
so we went somewhere

669
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:53,679
and he passed by a house where they kept there's
a bird is kept in a cage a bird cage okay

670
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:59,170
and and the bird

671
01:36:59,170 --> 01:37:04,090
recognized bodhidharma and said

672
01:37:04,090 --> 01:37:10,610
recognize somehow this bird recognized bodhidharma
as a sage so the bird asked him mind from

673
01:37:10,610 --> 01:37:17,170
the west mind from west please teach me a
way to escape from this cage uh flaming hair

674
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:24,550
can you do it in in a more birdy kind of way

675
01:37:24,550 --> 01:37:33,750
try your best word language now

676
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:40,220
very good very good yeah

677
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:46,869
one more time second version

678
01:37:46,869 --> 01:37:49,430
unmuted hey korea unmuted

679
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:59,210
i can't hear you master can you hear me okay
now now faster go okay mind from the west

680
01:37:59,210 --> 01:38:12,989
mind from the west please teach me how to
escape from this cage

681
01:38:12,989 --> 01:38:23,610
and bodhidharm immediately replied okay let's
find a new voice

682
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:28,170
china's chinese person there

683
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:37,830
huh so bodhidharma replied to escape from
the cages escape from the cage put out both

684
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:45,690
legs close both eyes this is a way to escape
from the cage okay spoke bird language

685
01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:51,360
and and

686
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,989
and

687
01:38:53,989 --> 01:38:56,400
and

688
01:38:56,400 --> 01:39:02,110
and that's what the bird did and uh the owner
thought the bird oh it was dead so open the

689
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:09,920
cage and try to to uh take the body out but
uh the bird flew out okay so that's how the

690
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:18,340
bird escaped okay the great escape if you
will great bird escape so anyway the story

691
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:25,420
legend has ShenGuang ran after bodhidharma
and went all the way to be a bear's ear mountain

692
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:34,489
in LuoYang and sat down facing a wall that's
right behind the future shaolin temple okay

693
01:39:34,489 --> 01:39:46,010
and ShenGuang knelt close by behind him apparently
for nine years and when i read this i said

694
01:39:46,010 --> 01:39:54,600
nine years uh how can you do that for nine
years well anyway so he sat for nine years

695
01:39:54,600 --> 01:40:06,650
and i'm first question is uh what about bathroom
breaks uh and uh and uh so they sat behind

696
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:14,130
uh master bodhidharma for for nine years and
bodhidharma ignored him completely didn't

697
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:26,080
talk to him for nine years okay and ShenGuang
never gave up it's a test it's a test and

698
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:35,560
and uh test of sincerity okay and one day
after nine years ShenGuang

699
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:41,530
never dared bother bodhidharma if you were
there and begging for instruction you don't

700
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:52,130
want to nag him you know Qun you hear you
don't want to nag okay uh i would not nag

701
01:40:52,130 --> 01:41:00,060
okay for something important i would not nag

702
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:06,570
and uh and uh

703
01:41:06,570 --> 01:41:10,719
and and one day

704
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:17,230
bodhidharma asked him a question this is very
important there's a protocol here you would

705
01:41:17,230 --> 01:41:24,980
kneel behind you ask for a favor you ask once
and you wait okay you don't nag and then and

706
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:30,400
then so he waited for nine years this is beautiful
this is so beautiful of a story to me okay

707
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:37,710
it is so important to you he said how do i
end birth and death venerable master teach

708
01:41:37,710 --> 01:41:46,510
me how to end birth and death all right you
don't text him to death

709
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:54,040
okay you ask once how can I end birth and
death and then you kneel down and you wait

710
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:57,389
you can do anything you like you can

711
01:41:57,389 --> 01:42:05,219
but you don't nag him anymore

712
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:13,090
the timing is always perfect

713
01:42:13,090 --> 01:42:23,969
and and uh so after nine years interestingly
uh this is so remarkable about venerable ShenGuang

714
01:42:23,969 --> 01:42:31,310
i'm impressed by that that for us in my era
waiting for nine years behind him like that

715
01:42:31,310 --> 01:42:36,869
is total nonsense the sheer nonsense i don't
know about you i cannot do this no way it

716
01:42:36,869 --> 01:42:41,119
doesn't make sense to me okay

717
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:45,820
that's why i'm glad that ShenGuang did it
for us

718
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:48,780
thank you china and

719
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:59,909
and uh and after nine years uh so it's like
it's interestingly like a delay how do i how

720
01:42:59,909 --> 01:43:07,520
how do i end birth and death okay and venerable
bodhidharma didn't say anything for nine years

721
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,870
ignore him completely and the guy would not
go away so after nine years and Bodhidharma

722
01:43:11,870 --> 01:43:15,630
saying you're still here

723
01:43:15,630 --> 01:43:20,060
what's the matter with you i said i'm waiting
for the answer i said i will answer you when

724
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:24,449
the snow becomes red

725
01:43:24,449 --> 01:43:34,480
and so ShenGuang uh uh got so upset and then
he took out a knife and cut his left arm right

726
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:43,639
arm this is what i don't remember his arm
right arm okay yeah i am right handed i think

727
01:43:43,639 --> 01:43:53,830
i would take my left arm cut my right arm
it shows more it's more emphatic

728
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:59,040
so in this movie of mine you take this knife
here this probably has not been sharpened

729
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:06,250
yet and you hack away your arm

730
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:11,900
so anyway so it finally cut off and fell to
the ground and the snow become red became

731
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:20,170
red so he scooped up some red snow with tainted
with blood corrupt with blood and then and

732
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:26,630
then and so great master great master hey
this the snow there's red snow the snow has

733
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:35,080
become red and uh now master XuanHua says
uh venerable ShenGuang was so upset he had

734
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:41,619
a temper so he cut his arm off to show him
uh he's probably right i would never disagree

735
01:44:41,619 --> 01:44:54,050
with my my chinese teacher okay yeah ching
[Laughter] so so Bodhidharma is impressed

736
01:44:54,050 --> 01:45:05,159
and and they say ah and you you are a pretty
tough cookie

737
01:45:05,159 --> 01:45:10,840
and and and uh

738
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:20,369
and so it is so it is it says wow you're tough
so you're tough okay

739
01:45:20,369 --> 01:45:32,710
right so it is you're so tough so am i okay
you're crazy so am i

740
01:45:32,710 --> 01:45:44,680
and he says he says you are worthy to be my
student okay so i will teach you i teach you

741
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:53,449
what i know okay and uh so my weight has not
been in vain imagine this guy this great teacher

742
01:45:53,449 --> 01:46:02,380
has been looking for a descendant for a successor
for a long time he saw it in venerable ShenGuang

743
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:12,219
but still put him through the test okay a
lot of in buddhism is about enduring the test

744
01:46:12,219 --> 01:46:23,739
okay and and that's called what what is that
called

745
01:46:23,739 --> 01:46:31,150
gradual teaching the tests are gradual teaching

746
01:46:31,150 --> 01:46:42,640
you see that that's how mahayana was transmitted
from india to china

747
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:53,880
gradually teaching for nine years so he sat
there he knelt behind him for nine years so

748
01:46:53,880 --> 01:47:01,550
every day he said oh my legs hurt i hurt so
much what am i doing here what am i doing

749
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:08,800
here i can't even tell my mother about this

750
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:12,920
she doesn't want me to become a monk in the
first place now i had to tell her i'm kneeing

751
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:21,260
behind this dark-skinned monk who cannot speak
a single word of chinese and when he decides

752
01:47:21,260 --> 01:47:27,460
to teach me how we're gonna what are we gonna
use google translate

753
01:47:27,460 --> 01:47:34,340
you see he has so many issues there that's
unresolved okay and yet he knelt and bodhidharma

754
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:42,500
didn't talk to him he didn't dare ask okay
yeah and and uh so part of the teaching is

755
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:48,860
you need to go through hardship because that's
part of your gradual training

756
01:47:48,860 --> 01:48:00,380
don't expect shortcuts they say tell me the
best thing give me the give me the sudden

757
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:08,730
teaching right away okay no you have to pass
the test you have to go through the gradual

758
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:17,239
training first and then there's a final test
when you actually have to cut off your arm

759
01:48:17,239 --> 01:48:21,949
is that a question you asked do you have to
cut off your arm yes i have a question it's

760
01:48:21,949 --> 01:48:27,719
another question a little bit random uh it's
associated what you just talk about the conversation

761
01:48:27,719 --> 01:48:34,370
between ShenGuang and uh um Bodhidharma yeah
like i'm curious back then what kind of language

762
01:48:34,370 --> 01:48:39,750
they are using when they communicate with
each other do they speak chinese or do they

763
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:46,460
speak indian language how did they communicate
with each other

764
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:51,520
[Music] what did i tell you

765
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:59,130
i will forgive you this one time you never
ask a question i cannot answer okay i'm sorry

766
01:48:59,130 --> 01:49:09,260
okay don't do it again next question how do
i know i wasn't there but if i have to lie

767
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:17,800
to you okay how do they communicate that's
a good question you see you're so lucky i

768
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:24,820
am so lenient because i had the same question
too i said you know the guy didn't speak chinese

769
01:49:24,820 --> 01:49:30,639
and the other guy didn't speak indian how
could they talk snow red and all those things

770
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:36,330
is not vocabulary come on i'm missing something
here yes old monk

771
01:49:36,330 --> 01:50:14,210
[Venerable XianChi speaking in Vietnamese]

772
01:50:14,210 --> 01:51:04,340
ok let master XianRen translate this important
message um master whatever the sage sageely

773
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:13,300
people did we cannot talk about it but uh
earlier we went through the story that the

774
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:19,920
patriarch talked to the bird actually the
bird asked the question and then the patriarch

775
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:28,500
give it the instruction and then the bird
understand and then another story is Yongan

776
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:38,119
when she meditate and she saw amitabha buddha
appeared wearing a yellow rope and she uh

777
01:51:38,119 --> 01:51:44,610
in her mind arrives a question like why the
buddha where why amitabh buddha wear yellow

778
01:51:44,610 --> 01:51:50,949
rope and suddenly an answer came to her mind
like wait until you die that's when i will

779
01:51:50,949 --> 01:52:00,360
wear a red rope so the buddha can communicate
through the mind and the same thing like in

780
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:11,070
1976 when i was in the prison and then i in
my dream i saw buddha appear and then i i

781
01:52:11,070 --> 01:52:16,250
have a question i had a question in my mind
and then suddenly the buddha answered me using

782
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:22,449
the vietnamese he didn't use chinese or english
or whatever he used vietnamese to help me

783
01:52:22,449 --> 01:52:29,930
to understand so in the sutra avatamsaka sutra
say that the buddha has a lot of different

784
01:52:29,930 --> 01:52:36,489
way to communicate to help beings understand

785
01:52:36,489 --> 01:52:49,500
you get that you buy that you believe anything
do you

786
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:58,889
when you think you think in what language

787
01:52:58,889 --> 01:53:03,580
you think in chinese yes yes

788
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:12,469
in you think vietnamese or english english
okay but you are vietnamese right

789
01:53:12,469 --> 01:53:19,369
okay vietnamese chinese her mother is vietnamese
chinese okay so you have chinese here english

790
01:53:19,369 --> 01:53:20,369
here

791
01:53:20,369 --> 01:53:33,079
XiaoTai when you think what do you think in
what language do you use

792
01:53:33,079 --> 01:53:40,570
chinese and english chinese and english half
chinese half english very good okay you see

793
01:53:40,570 --> 01:53:55,739
so uh so what happened is that the thinking
do you really think is in chinese or english

794
01:53:55,739 --> 01:54:02,770
how come she thinks in english how come you
think in in chinese

795
01:54:02,770 --> 01:54:16,290
before you verbalize it right when you think
chinese [Some Garbled Chinese]

796
01:54:16,290 --> 01:54:25,159
so these are thoughts how come sees she hears
herself as in chinese and she hears herself

797
01:54:25,159 --> 01:54:31,570
as english why

798
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:40,590
my master when i was a novice and i was supposed
to train to sit sleep okay and i hate it i

799
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:48,320
hate it say we suffer all day eat one meal
a day and we can't even sleep with in comfort

800
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:53,079
what kind of what kind of nonsense is this
so i really struggled with that concept having

801
01:54:53,079 --> 01:55:00,449
to sit sleep and i tried two years unsuccessfully
okay

802
01:55:00,449 --> 01:55:08,710
and then one night in long beach monastry
after two years okay i was sleeping i started

803
01:55:08,710 --> 01:55:15,889
as usual with sitting and then eventually
i slide down slowly slowly slowly slowly and

804
01:55:15,889 --> 01:55:22,719
lean against the wall and then pretty soon
you unbuckle a little bit

805
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:26,190
a little bit very slow motion and eventually

806
01:55:26,190 --> 01:55:40,340
us like that no no not even

807
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:51,869
actually listening to our lecture seriously
he's not even playing his kids out there

808
01:55:51,869 --> 01:56:02,590
and and one night i was doing that like every
single night okay and one night i heard

809
01:56:02,590 --> 01:56:13,040
i heard master XuanHua's voice okay he said
he said uh

810
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,840
get up

811
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:20,030
cross your legs

812
01:56:20,030 --> 01:56:26,239
he's screaming at me seriously

813
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:37,139
and i immediately jumped up crossed my legs
without thinking i was so scared i never saw

814
01:56:37,139 --> 01:56:43,560
him that angry i always have this you know
the last time i saw me was you know he was

815
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:50,139
dying okay he was on his deathbed he said
oh i love you you know and you're all so good

816
01:56:50,139 --> 01:56:57,170
you're such a wonderful student and so forth
okay but never been that angry before okay

817
01:56:57,170 --> 01:57:04,050
i was so scared i immediately crossed my legs
and set the rest of the night in full lotus

818
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:12,310
and right after that i could easily sit in
full lotus every single night

819
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:14,780
okay and the instruction he gave me was

820
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:17,270
in

821
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:31,310
in i call you i'm looking at her i'm calling
your name in

822
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:39,079
is the first time you attend my sutra lecture
can i make use of you as a prop after 10 years

823
01:57:39,079 --> 01:57:43,969
he's finally attended my sutra lecture the
first time

824
01:57:43,969 --> 01:58:03,800
is that right you never attended my lecture
before i didn't count not until today

825
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:09,369
exactly i think he spoke english he spoke
in english

826
01:58:09,369 --> 01:58:14,699
okay yeah why

827
01:58:14,699 --> 01:58:15,699
it's more direct

828
01:58:15,699 --> 01:58:27,050
i think that's all i could think of because
i think in english

829
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:33,120
i don't think in vietnamese i think in english
unless i talk to the vietnamese and then i

830
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:40,360
think in vietnamese but typically when i talk
to normal people non-vietnamese i think in

831
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:47,050
english but when i talk to the old monk then
i switch to vietnamese in my thoughts just

832
01:58:47,050 --> 01:58:54,940
like you that's just like the boy what happened
to him now

833
01:58:54,940 --> 01:59:03,159
okay so the point here is that if master XuanHua
can talk to me in english to make sure i understood

834
01:59:03,159 --> 01:59:12,989
because that's my pattern unless you're vietnamese
i only think in english so in order to teach

835
01:59:12,989 --> 01:59:22,000
me he used english to make sure i got the
message immediately no interpretation no translation

836
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:29,389
yes green is it really he spoke english or
yes it's just your mind translated i heard

837
01:59:29,389 --> 01:59:45,010
his voice that anger i am traumatized for
the rest of my life

838
01:59:45,010 --> 01:59:53,969
and as i just think about revisit that moment
i'm still shaking right now it's how scary

839
01:59:53,969 --> 02:00:01,500
he's violent that's when i first learned about
violence it's okay to be violent towards your

840
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:04,389
disciples

841
02:00:04,389 --> 02:00:14,280
okay yes so so the point here is that uh here's
what happens

842
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:15,760
your thought has no language

843
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:27,090
thoughts have no language for example when
i taught that boy yesterday the troublemaker

844
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:30,810
about shame on you

845
02:00:30,810 --> 02:00:37,810
okay when he was about to cry you remember
you know he fell on his butt his right butt

846
02:00:37,810 --> 02:00:46,380
and he got up and he was going like this and
he's bound to to cry and i laugh and

847
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:55,170
say so i said shame on you you know and he
immediately got the message okay that right

848
02:00:55,170 --> 02:01:00,930
there when i taught him right there talking
about shame okay it's not in english at all

849
02:01:00,930 --> 02:01:11,920
it's not in chinese at all he does not understand
chinese i only taught him about this conscious

850
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,930
thought called shame

851
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:21,130
he got it right away he stood up and he didn't
he didn't cry he stopped his he's about to

852
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:26,670
cry so i immediately tested him and said you
should be ashamed instead of crying so immediately

853
02:01:26,670 --> 02:01:36,429
yeah i'm not going to cry he ran over there
and he hit himself

854
02:01:36,429 --> 02:01:42,889
so the communications had no language he got
it so yesterday i was playing with him i taught

855
02:01:42,889 --> 02:01:51,349
him five different emotions and he got them
all so the thought in communication has no

856
02:01:51,349 --> 02:02:00,599
language but you add another layer on top
of yourself because you need to talk to your

857
02:02:00,599 --> 02:02:06,920
thinking mind so that's why you translated
internally your wiring it translated from

858
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:16,969
that thought language which is pure thoughts
into english uh chinese excuse me

859
02:02:16,969 --> 02:02:29,280
taiwanese or chinese chinese mandarin okay
whereas that one there is english

860
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:40,290
okay so that's why that's how they could communicate
it turns out by the way for important lessons

861
02:02:40,290 --> 02:02:50,210
important teachings you cannot afford to be
be be distracted by languages so i'm sure

862
02:02:50,210 --> 02:02:56,079
that bodhidharma and venerable bodhidharma
he when he wanted to teach ShenGuang he could

863
02:02:56,079 --> 02:03:01,660
talk to him directly through his mind and
ShenGuang could understand okay and the this

864
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:07,590
is the storytelling where master XuanHua would
explain it to us in chinese and we translate

865
02:03:07,590 --> 02:03:16,179
it into english so it's for our understanding
but for them it's direct very direct mind

866
02:03:16,179 --> 02:03:21,949
to mind if you will okay just like you um

867
02:03:21,949 --> 02:03:28,550
venerable Bodhidharma send him a thought okay
ex talked him in in thoughts and ShenGuang

868
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:34,420
would translate that thought into chinese
if you will that's what happened

869
02:03:34,420 --> 02:03:45,599
does it help okay just remember no more questions
today

870
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:51,130
but he's uh the old monk is correct okay he's
right but he does you understand that's the

871
02:03:51,130 --> 02:03:59,420
exactly the first layer is thought thought
has no language thought is just taught when

872
02:03:59,420 --> 02:04:06,579
you you do mind you're able to read mind like
venerable bodhidharma okay you can read people's

873
02:04:06,579 --> 02:04:12,430
mind that has no language okay he can read
your mind her mind your mind is in chinese

874
02:04:12,430 --> 02:04:18,190
her mind's vietnamese and his mind and god
knows what language we don't know okay so

875
02:04:18,190 --> 02:04:23,210
it doesn't matter at all so the first layer
is thought thought is just thought and then

876
02:04:23,210 --> 02:04:27,500
next layer is language

877
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:33,070
all right that's how it works next

878
02:04:33,070 --> 02:04:44,570
so this gradual teaching that bodhidharma
did for ShenGuang span nine years it's very

879
02:04:44,570 --> 02:04:55,280
important okay do not expect immediate results
like we in our era are accustomed to instant

880
02:04:55,280 --> 02:05:08,869
gratification it takes time okay it takes
time to prepare it takes time to

881
02:05:08,869 --> 02:05:19,400
let the wine mature properly you cannot rush
it even soy sauce needs to mature naturally

882
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:28,369
is that clear or fish sauce for that matter
go ahead wei mountain

883
02:05:28,369 --> 02:05:38,580
master when the that baby yesterday you play
that he fall down did you read his mind [Laughter]

884
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:42,179
yes

885
02:05:42,179 --> 02:05:45,190
now you mentioned it now you brought it up
yes

886
02:05:45,190 --> 02:05:55,640
oh what a stupid question of course i did
i mean

887
02:05:55,640 --> 02:06:09,739
occasionally because yesterday i i finally
found my soul mate a mischievous mind that

888
02:06:09,739 --> 02:06:15,380
boy was causing trouble all afternoon for
four hours while you were here the small gathering

889
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:20,290
is still like five six of us get gathered
together and talking and telling your stories

890
02:06:20,290 --> 02:06:25,889
and so forth the mind the boy was you know
creating mischief after mischief and so forth

891
02:06:25,889 --> 02:06:33,180
oh this boy sounds like my kind of soul mate
so i intrigued me i said so i was starting

892
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:38,000
to say i was i started paying attention what
he was going through his mind how does he

893
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:46,030
create mischiefs so i was more intrigued by
that okay so so i i so i was able to connect

894
02:06:46,030 --> 02:06:51,530
with him at that mischievous level that's
it and you call it thought reading mind reading

895
02:06:51,530 --> 02:06:56,110
so be it guilty

896
02:06:56,110 --> 02:07:05,869
okay so anyway so bodhidharma uh so the real
question is now how does he transmit the teaching

897
02:07:05,869 --> 02:07:12,940
mind to mind teaching this is very very precise
language how is he gonna teach something he

898
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:17,989
does not understand the language or speak
the language okay you wouldn't i would not

899
02:07:17,989 --> 02:07:25,520
dare use the chinese to teach you mind to
mind for example never because my chinese

900
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:36,719
is horrible okay so but bodhidharma decided
to transmit the sudden teaching the chan dharma

901
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:46,429
door here okay translation for you chan dharma
door here is sudden teaching because he taught

902
02:07:46,429 --> 02:07:53,790
the chan dharma door for nine years already
the gradual dharma door okay venerable ShenGuang

903
02:07:53,790 --> 02:08:08,400
saw how bodhidharma was teaching him not by
language not by thoughts but by what

904
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:09,400
by what

905
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:17,500
by what

906
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:28,469
yes chinese person tests tests no tests that's
too chinese anyone else

907
02:08:28,469 --> 02:08:32,969
yes from the philippines

908
02:08:32,969 --> 02:08:42,099
you you want to make it sound so like we are
so international

909
02:08:42,099 --> 02:08:53,349
yes by his behavior no wrong philippines doesn't
have it yellow yes emituofo by uh he sat for

910
02:08:53,349 --> 02:09:00,400
nine years as well

911
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:03,040
anyone else old monk i'm sure the old monk
wants to say something

912
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:18,719
[Laughter] don't even translate green by uh
let him suffer

913
02:09:18,719 --> 02:09:31,790
pretty good not quite but yeah it's pretty
good it's pretty good it's pretty good excellent

914
02:09:31,790 --> 02:09:41,030
and you are devious i would be careful you
know if i were your husband

915
02:09:41,030 --> 02:09:42,030
anyone else

916
02:09:42,030 --> 02:09:50,639
by

917
02:09:50,639 --> 02:09:59,889
doing

918
02:09:59,889 --> 02:10:05,780
so for example this is just my imagination
okay please take a grain of salt there's no

919
02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:10,599
proof don't ask me

920
02:10:10,599 --> 02:10:16,532
how do you know i was talking a korean person
you know two nights ago and she says why are

921
02:10:16,532 --> 02:10:23,199
you so sure

922
02:10:23,199 --> 02:10:29,659
you don't ask someone that you know are you
sure you how can you be so sure i mean it's

923
02:10:29,659 --> 02:10:36,050
not not proper anyway

924
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:44,840
what bodhidharma did for ShenGuang is that
if you can imagine ShenGuang is his hot stuff

925
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:53,869
he's revered by lay people he's he's uh he's
well respected impressed by the heavenly beings

926
02:10:53,869 --> 02:10:59,909
okay he's a hot shot okay but ShenGuang is
not used to kneeling behind someone like that

927
02:10:59,909 --> 02:11:07,869
so initially i assure you ShenGuang had thoughts
of quitting he said this is nonsense okay

928
02:11:07,869 --> 02:11:15,370
it's going nowhere what am i doing let's go
back and face death it's less embarrassing

929
02:11:15,370 --> 02:11:22,260
than this how can i explain to my supporters
i knew behind this dark skinned monk bushy

930
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:29,889
beard who ignores me completely

931
02:11:29,889 --> 02:11:42,239
okay and when these thoughts of quitting arose
in in in in ShenGuang's mind bodhidharma would

932
02:11:42,239 --> 02:11:46,670
do something

933
02:11:46,670 --> 02:11:51,380
and the thought would die

934
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:59,369
okay so ShenGuang actually received help from
bodhidharma invisibly otherwise there's no

935
02:11:59,369 --> 02:12:07,429
way ShenGuang could have lasted nine years
so what Bodhidharma did for ShenGuang is that

936
02:12:07,429 --> 02:12:18,989
he invisibly helped ShenGuang not quit otherwise
you have quit nine years ago a long long time

937
02:12:18,989 --> 02:12:26,150
ago does it make sense to you no ordinary
person unless they be they are sage would

938
02:12:26,150 --> 02:12:32,219
do this silly thing for nine years that's
impossible that's totally nonsense unless

939
02:12:32,219 --> 02:12:43,300
he was helped is that clear okay so don't
be so full yourself your progress actually

940
02:12:43,300 --> 02:12:51,219
is your practice has a lot of help from a
lot of good guys we're on the good side of

941
02:12:51,219 --> 02:12:56,840
the fence of the railroad tracks okay when
you do this good thing here you receive so

942
02:12:56,840 --> 02:13:03,540
much help trust me so ShenGuang got help from
bodhidharma because budidharma would make

943
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:11,849
sure that he was not he would not quit okay
and then for example in the summertime it's

944
02:13:11,849 --> 02:13:19,760
very very hot okay and and ShenGuang was perspiring
for example and he said i can't take this

945
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:26,480
much i'm going to pass out this heat and all
sun this is a light breeze

946
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:36,030
so the dharma protectors would blow air cool
air not hot air

947
02:13:36,030 --> 02:13:41,969
seriously when you are hot someone does this
for you it's it changes it gives you the kind

948
02:13:41,969 --> 02:13:49,940
of relief that's so much appreciated so ShenGuang
had a lot of help a lot of support because

949
02:13:49,940 --> 02:13:58,130
not only bodhidharma was helping him the dharma
protectors around venerable Bodhidharma will

950
02:13:58,130 --> 02:14:05,969
also assisting him you know in so many invisible
ways we on the good side guys if you think

951
02:14:05,969 --> 02:14:11,250
that the demons are causing a lot of problems
out there i assure you the good guys are also

952
02:14:11,250 --> 02:14:23,150
helping us as well okay that's what happened
that's the only way that this could have transpired

953
02:14:23,150 --> 02:14:27,500
in my opinion

954
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:29,730
lesson

955
02:14:29,730 --> 02:14:37,170
don't be so full of yourself we're receiving
a lot of help a lot more help than we are

956
02:14:37,170 --> 02:14:41,260
aware of

957
02:14:41,260 --> 02:14:55,510
all right say anyway

958
02:14:55,510 --> 02:15:03,320
okay yeah why do we go into uh

959
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:05,070
大慧宗杲

960
02:15:05,070 --> 02:15:12,929
大慧宗杲 whatever okay uh so anyway the
main thing here i don't know why we're going

961
02:15:12,929 --> 02:15:19,590
to do this this uh this uh that way here okay
but my interesting the interesting point here

962
02:15:19,590 --> 02:15:33,059
is that venerable Bodhidharma transmitted
the sudden teaching to okay and that is the

963
02:15:33,059 --> 02:15:45,190
seal behind the transmission from generation
generation somehow they have to transmit the

964
02:15:45,190 --> 02:15:54,420
sudden teaching to next generation because
that is the essence of chan that is essence

965
02:15:54,420 --> 02:16:07,179
of mahayana i'm sorry korean sunims chan is
not it's not seon is not is not uh Huatou

966
02:16:07,179 --> 02:16:22,510
okay seon is the sudden teaching

967
02:16:22,510 --> 02:16:29,360
that's how you can tell whether you have real
chan or not for example in japan they don't

968
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:37,109
have sudden teaching at all there's no mention
of it yeah from the documents i read in english

969
02:16:37,109 --> 02:16:47,219
no mention of sudden teaching it's all about
you know hinayana aspects of child of meditation

970
02:16:47,219 --> 02:16:48,219
all right

971
02:16:48,219 --> 02:16:58,559
uh anyway i don't know why we had 43 here
at the [unintellible] here uh real chan on

972
02:16:58,559 --> 02:17:13,750
the uh so so so after venerable bodhidharma
taught ShenGuang okay that special sudden

973
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:20,030
teaching right there ShenGuang immediately
became enlightened that's how you transmit

974
02:17:20,030 --> 02:17:23,870
the sudden teaching

975
02:17:23,870 --> 02:17:34,069
then bodhidharma recognized ShenGuang yeah
was was uh was uh was right there at the threshold

976
02:17:34,069 --> 02:17:43,550
okay and then uh ShenGuang who then later
became HuiKe said uh uh now that the arm hurts

977
02:17:43,550 --> 02:17:53,510
yeah and he says uh my my i am troubled by
my the pain my arm okay please help me uh

978
02:17:53,510 --> 02:18:00,790
calm my mind down and bodhidharma says bring
me your mind i will calm it down for you and

979
02:18:00,790 --> 02:18:08,150
HuiKe says i can't find my mind how can i
bring it to you okay i said then i pacified

980
02:18:08,150 --> 02:18:18,380
your mind and at that point HuiKe uh huike
then [Music] cross the threshold and went

981
02:18:18,380 --> 02:18:27,769
into the world the realm of enlightenment

982
02:18:27,769 --> 02:18:36,069
time is up oh my god time is up so sorry korea
