the unsurpassed profound subtle and wonderful
dharma in a hundred thousand million eons

11
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,840
is difficult to encounter now that i'm able
to see in here I will receive and maintain

12
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:56,010
it I vow to fathom then thus come one's true
and actual principles [Music]

[Music]

14
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:34,000
[Music] to [Music]

15
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,220
hello everyone thank you all for coming it's
nice to see you today is the 30th of october

16
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:48,009
2021 and we are

17
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:57,910
continuing to discuss the sixth patriarch sutra we're
starting over we're on slide number 45. thank

18
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:06,630
you very much okay so in in the midst of the
story between bodhidharma and how he transmitted

19
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:23,479
chan to the second patriarch the um the um
uh this uh second patriarch venerable HuiKe

20
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:30,289
okay before he was ShenGuang, ShenGuang is
his dharma name but then after he became second

21
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:38,900
patriarch venerable bodhidharma was very kind and gave him
a dharma name and that's what he used um uh

22
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:49,779
so uh so after after the uh after venerable HuiKe
became enlightened and he went through a lot

23
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:58,589
of hardship uh imagine yourself having to
kneel for nine hours I mean nine years sorry

24
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:08,399
not hours nine hours pretty easy uh nine years
all day okay and back then I don't think they

25
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:17,200
invented the full lotus posture yet

26
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
no i'm kidding

27
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:30,480
i thought I think full lotus came from india
but in china I think it's probably the case

28
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,760
where uh the chinese didn't believe in full
lotus and that's why he made them kneel

29
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:43,320
for nine years he said see how tough you chinese
people are

30
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,910
and after that HuiKe up knew better I said
oh we better learn teach Chinese how to do

31
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,070
full lotus

32
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:58,940
because I don't think anyone would be stupid
enough like me to kneel for nine years like

33
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:09,370
this okay it's extraordinary of a feat you
see this this uh this monk here was uh extraordinary

34
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:18,890
of a monk okay and extraordinary people moved
through extraordinary extraordinarily difficult

35
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:27,470
tasks so don't complain you know I said I'm
too sleepy and sit in full lotus then get

36
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,040
up and kneel for nine years

37
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:39,720
you're such a wimp

38
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:53,339
okay uh so uh this is so so anyway so HuiKe
when venerable HuiKe, second patriarch HuiKe uh had to

39
00:10:53,339 --> 00:11:03,910
prove himself for nine years before master
Bodhidharma decided to teach him

40
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:14,200
so after he taught HuiKe taught him the sudden
teaching dharma he named him HuiKe meaning

41
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:28,160
wise and able uh Hui(慧) here is refers to prajna
wisdom okay meaning that he's certified HuiKe

42
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:40,380
as the first chinese monk to have prajna
wisdom that's why hui comes first not last

43
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:50,139
okay Ke(可) here refers that uh he's able to

44
00:11:50,139 --> 00:12:03,149
carry on the burden of propagating Mahayana
he's able to carry on the transmission of

45
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:07,190
this wonderful sudden teaching Dharma door

46
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:19,700
all right so oh that's a word of encouragement
i deem you worthy so carry on

47
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:32,190
and um and uh so HuiKe asked great master Bodhidharma in india do you transmit the dharma

48
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:43,209
to your disciples did you also give robe and
bowl as certification okay and 46 uh Bohdidharma

49
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:48,160
replied I transmitted the dharma in India
of course what do you

50
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:55,450
think it's just like

51
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:02,829
just like you just gave it to us right I mean
you know not the Indians right your own kind

52
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:05,450
we better right uh

53
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:15,560
there's a little bit of racism in here if
I I think and so Bodhidharma has to say yes

54
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:21,170
of course I transmitted the Dharma I taught
the sudden teaching in India as well but

55
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:29,260
I did not use a robe and bowl Indian people
are straightforward to attain fruition they

56
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:37,300
know they must be certified that comes from
the tradition from the great first patriarch

57
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:45,180
Indian patriarch Mahākāśyapa okay if no one certifies
them they do not say I have attained the way

58
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:52,430
I have given proof to arhatship I am a
bodhisattva okay so he's saying that the you

59
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:58,000
Chinese people are not as straightforward
as the Indian back then that is not the case

60
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
anymore

61
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,870
unfortunately uh and unfortunately the Chinese
tend to lie

62
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:14,220
it's probably translation error you know you
know you don't want to bring the Dharma to Chinese

63
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,410
say you are a bunch of liars

64
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:24,500
many claim sagehood although they fully know
they aren't that's what Indians do by the

65
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,139
way it's not just the Chinese Indians do that
too nowadays therefore I transmit the robe

66
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:36,480
and bowl to prove that you have received transmission
in other words there's only one robe and bowl

67
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:44,260
ever gave to the Indian I'm not going to give
it to you so uh I said oh that's uh the answer

68
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:54,070
and that's the completes the cycle of certification
so we certified uh that HuiKe was enlightened

69
00:14:54,070 --> 00:15:04,199
and then he also uh uh gave him the robe
and bowl as well okay and that's uh happy ending

70
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:14,320
uh story uh and venerable Bodhidharma according to
master XuanHua was poisoned six times

71
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:23,690
some of them were really famous Chinese monks
Indian monks his contemporaries and that's

72
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:35,930
comes with the job okay you you do something
important uh the uh your peers are your worst

73
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,930
enemies

74
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:50,400
okay uh and and that's the nature of the Chinese
competition they can't beat you they poison

75
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
you

76
00:15:51,400 --> 00:16:06,170
I take it back uh not the Chinese and the
monks in general if they can't compete with

77
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:16,269
you they do things to uh destroy you to harm
you uh and that's the way it is okay yeah

78
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:25,839
you don't like it don't be patriarch stop
complaining uh so and and uh venerable Bodhidharma

79
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:34,000
also gave a prediction he says why am I doing
this I'm doing this not only to give this

80
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,459
to you this precious Dharma here

81
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:54,120
okay I do this because you are just
a vehicle just a bridge for

82
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:03,690
the propagation for the Dharma to be propagated
to future generations where there will be

83
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:12,789
the case one flower opens uh the five petals
um okay uh this refers to the fact in the

84
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:23,829
future that there is a a monk by the name
of MaZu well very famous very competent Chinese

85
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:33,880
patriarch who then had five eminent disciples
okay and from his uh that uh that learned

86
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,760
from him and later uh did great things for
the Chan school and for Mahayana in general

87
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:48,850
so venerable Bodhidharama says you know you make sure
that you pass on this knowledge because uh

88
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:58,429
there's a in the future you need this bloodline
this transmission to go to future generations

89
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:08,660
so that it will blossom eventually okay that's
the way it has to be in China back then Q&A

90
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:18,200
go ahead uh quick question master why did
Bodhidharma make venerable HuiKe kneel for

91
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:27,740
nine years before telling him to wait until
the snow turns red why not just tell him wait

92
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:34,300
at the very beginning wait until the snow
turns red yeah I could have said oh yeah yeah

93
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:46,160
oh yeah uh he could have said you
know in the future in nine years later there

94
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:56,940
is uh the Dharma will be transmitted somehow
so you hang in there right no it turns out

95
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:06,260
that uh I don't know because I cannot speak
for master Bodhidharma okay Bodhidharma

96
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:17,789
is is a great great sage from India okay so
uh and and and you can tell it's a great sage

97
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:33,200
because uh he went through a lot of hardship
and he he his hardship proved that great men

98
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:43,049
walked the difficult paths that's what makes
them great

99
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:57,510
it's never easy for these people okay so he
uh he he um he taught this Chinese guy who

100
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,560
did not sit in full lotus

101
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:14,320
okay so uh so this part of this nine years
here is to help him understand that in order

102
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,500
to become enlightened you must endure suffering

103
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:28,929
if you are not willing to endure suffering
you will not become enlightened

104
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:40,370
so if you know and and you can imagine do
you you think that HuiKe when he was great

105
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:49,160
master HuiKe when he was kneeling behind Bodhidharma
did he say oh ouch ouch out there's mosquito

106
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:58,530
here master master

107
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:06,140
okay it's raining can we stop can we can we
take a break I'm having a I have a cold today

108
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:14,159
I think it covid 17.

109
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,840
so you see they went through a lot you we
only see it as nine years actually they went

110
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:28,559
through so much okay so many things occur
that was not even worthy to be recorded and

111
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,850
the simple thing is just you kneel there for nine
years see if you can do that see how many

112
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:48,220
people can do that okay uh and and that's
what enabled HuiKe

113
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:57,970
to be ready for the transmission okay so according
to venerable Bodhidharma conditions were that that's

114
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:05,669
what he felt that HuiKe was has to go through
for for nine years basically the test is that

115
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:15,799
aren't you gonna give up every day aren't
you going to give up China's Chinese person

116
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:22,330
are you going to give up

117
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,580
and what did HuiKe have to work with

118
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:37,549
nothing

119
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:46,429
he has no fourty two hands and eyes

120
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:53,200
remember he's a dharma master he lectures
on sutras he doesn't know how to cultivate

121
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,010
didn't have any great compassion mantra

122
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,870
didn't have any Buddha's name to recite

123
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:11,159
have no Medicine Master Buddha blessings see
how weak you are you have all those things

124
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:13,120
HuiKe had nothing whatsoever

125
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:21,049
so what did he have how did he survive

126
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:25,419
you think

127
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:32,620
with Covid and you know SARS and you know
going around the country you know and hunger

128
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,919
and pain in the legs in the back aches

129
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:44,080
sleepiness

130
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:52,740
Q&A what do you have to work with Q&A

131
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,740
okay

132
00:23:53,740 --> 00:24:57,990
master I think like the fact that

133
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:06,500
master HuiKe can kneel for nine years because
before that there was the ghost the impermanent

134
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,840
ghost came and then say that okay it's time
for you to die and then he was asking like

135
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,820
is there any way that I can get help or can
you wait for me and then they give him a tips

136
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:26,470
like the monk that you uh knock down two teeth
he's the one that already escaped birth and

137
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:33,559
death so HuiKe he has no other way to turn
so that that's why he has to kneel for nine

138
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:43,850
years to wait for Bodhidharma to teach him
and rescue him from the death and then the

139
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:52,520
patriarch YinGuang he also say that if you
want to be uh vigorous you just have to think

140
00:25:52,520 --> 00:26:01,220
that the death is coming so that is one way
to help you to be vigorous and work hard and

141
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:10,050
then for me the price he has to pay to kneel
for nine years like uh because of the offenses

142
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:18,000
he beat up on the arhat and then just
nine years that is a very cheap uh light punishment

143
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,380
otherwise he will be fall into the um the
hell and stay there forever very good good

144
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:36,720
answer that's it yeah exactly in summary what's
this alternative if he quits what's going

145
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:50,559
to happen he dies so he has no choice but
to hang in there okay and so he uh he had

146
00:26:50,559 --> 00:27:02,070
to somehow find a way to survive okay and
he cannot afford he cannot afford to quit

147
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:12,340
that's why so that's which brings to mind
uh a recently a disciple of mine she says

148
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:19,100
you know I got so much out of the chan Dharma door here it does wonders for me but I don't

149
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:28,290
know how I can uh share with my colleagues
I know they need it desperately but I don't

150
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:32,539
know how I can share it with them

151
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:42,100
okay and then I didn't say anything but the
answer is

152
00:27:42,100 --> 00:28:02,409
what oh monk see if you can do it again

153
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:09,899
he was he relaxes oh I hit I hit the bull's
eye so I can relax no I came right back at

154
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:23,059
him no time to relax HuiKe who has to do
for nine years in a row you can't relax

155
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:24,059
caught red-handed

156
00:28:24,059 --> 00:29:05,990
[Venerable XianChi speaking Vietnamese]

157
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:11,630
anyone else I knew it

158
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:15,080
anyone else hmm

159
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:21,100
yes Diego let's hear some south american wisdom
here

160
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:29,540
well thank you master uh I don't think
I'm just bragging It's just It's as if you

161
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:38,230
know you came from oh yeah from south america
somewhere bogota or yeah and you know calling

162
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:47,890
in and you know yes sorry yeah I'm from bogota
you got it right

163
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:53,169
thank you master, I don't think she has to do anything
because that would be like interfere with

164
00:29:53,169 --> 00:30:00,299
them I feel she just have to teach by example
so when when they see that they are following

165
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:10,710
the precepts and and like their life has changed
so much they will naturally approach to her

166
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,769
ummmm anyone else

167
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:23,100

00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:44,019
差不多如是，差不多如是 anyone else yes sir four along the
lines Diego was saying just if if they improve

170
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:52,930
themselves eventually the people will ask
so when they ask that's when you can say something

171
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,820
um

172
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,880
anyone else what

173
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,570
conch

174
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:13,870
master he also had help from GuanYin and
the protectors around him and the Dharma protectors

175
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:23,130
did you dye your hair sorry what were you

178
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:38,919
what kind of question is that right okay never
mind what what's your answer again sorry the

179
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:48,140
hair distracted me one day's flaming the others
black I mean it's confusing

180
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:57,490
he he had the emergency help from Guanyin
and the the dharma the Dharma protectors don't

181
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:03,779
you wish okay anyone else

182
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:04,779
Q&A

183
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:16,019
master uh I think she needs to wait till they
have the need

184
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:27,419
to learn Chan umm so proud of you it's not something
southern California people can answer

185
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:32,559
the wisdom seems to have migrated up north

186
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:42,919
excellent very good hmm excellent

187
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:52,809
see I trick you I said uh I said uh she saw
the need their needs to do it but the key

188
00:32:52,809 --> 00:33:00,510
is do they see the need or not she she forgot
about herself she saw the need that's why

189
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:08,840
she did the Chan thing but unless people
see the needs they have real needs like HuiKe

190
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:17,389
here they won't do it there's no point in
forcing the issue you have to wait until they

191
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:27,480
see the need that's all okay and guess what
they eventually will see the needs all you

192
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,840
have to do is make yourself available you
know until then you make yourself available

193
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,659
my door is open you know my cubicle is open
you know

194
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:48,710
let's have a cup of tea next month you know
whatever you know but just make yourself available

195
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:54,640
that's all so that when they have the need
they'll come and ask you point number one

196
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:03,289
point number two like the south American wisdom
okay uh you don't do anything Chan is that we don't

197
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:11,589
scheme conch listen carefully we don't scheme
we don't have to scheme we don't have to sell

198
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:17,030
anything it's there and when they need it
they'll ask

199
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:29,899
okay so yes because they see people will see
and when you all you have to do is continue

200
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:41,450
to improve become better happier uh healthier
what -ier can we do

201
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:48,550
okay and then they see themselves and say
oh I need to be like that you see that so

202
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:54,810
that's a very subtle way the south American
way to make it very subtle to to to create

203
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,690
a need a little bit quicker by

204
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:09,560
look at me all right very good so one day
Bodhidharma called together the disciples

205
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:15,950
and said it's time has come for me
to return each of you say something to demonstrate

206
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:23,310
your understanding so this is uh seems to
start this silly thing that Chinese do you

207
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:32,160
know after you go to ChanQi they have an
exit interview and said give me your 心得

208
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:39,030
what is that you have in what insight did
you have

209
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:46,110
and that's what happened so I think Bodhidharma
is the one who started it all to mess up all

210
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:52,780
the chinese so now all the chinese do that
now you go to a Chinese Qi and you is not

211
00:35:52,780 --> 00:36:00,520
a real Qi unless when you finish you go through
exit interview and say what is that you what

212
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:10,490
is your understanding and they have to say
something okay and say 如是如是 everyone

213
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:17,800
says 如是如是 so it is so it is and then

214
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:26,619
they remain who they are okay so anyway say
something to demonstrate your understanding

215
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:35,190
this by the way is a trick question it's not
meant for them to imitate venerable Bodhidharma

216
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:45,520
said this to it's like a jab do you box it's
a left jab

217
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,720
see say something

218
00:36:50,720 --> 00:37:01,950
you got that a disciple named DaoFu said
as I see it function of the way is the function

219
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:10,829
of the way is not bound by word speech nor
is it separate from words and speech very

220
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:14,089
profound

221
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:26,000
shall we continue is it more you have attained
my skin

222
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,020
we continue first before I comment okay can
we do that is that okay I know you say say

223
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:36,440
something master say something master I said
no no that wait a little bit okay

224
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:47,369
the nun ZongChi said according to my understanding it is like
Ananda's glimpse of the realm of Akshobhya

225
00:37:47,369 --> 00:38:00,540
Buddha seen once it is never seen again Bodhidharma
said you have attained my flesh

226
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:10,150
a disciple named DaoYu four elements are all
empty the five skandas are without actual

227
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:17,650
existence I see that there is not a single
dharma to be grasped and we should have the

228
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:23,369
Chinese for this it annoys me when I don't
see Chinese in these translations because

229
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:32,619
I don't trust their translations at all okay
these people the Chinese translators don't

230
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:39,319
really understand Chan that's why I don't
trust any of them

231
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:46,450
okay in the future if you uh if you are you
people are preparing you notice for example

232
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:52,520
people have been working very hard preparing
like Korean here Vietnamese here Chinese here

233
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:58,470
okay so you know when you prepare can you
make sure that I have the Chinese version

234
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:03,140
here and they say oh my god master you're
asking about the impossible where am I going

235
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:07,410
to fit it I don't care

236
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:16,660
not my problem I just want Chinese somewhere
is it too much to ask stop complaining it

237
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:24,760
hurts too much nine years and not reasonable

238
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:35,089
okay so anyway and master Bodhidharma said
you obtained my bones okay finally without

239
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:44,780
saying HuiKe bowed and stood in his place
Bodhidharma said you have attained my marrow

240
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:54,569
precisely ah I forgot about this thing here
okay 48 going back to these four characters

241
00:39:54,569 --> 00:40:10,200
yeah yeah you see he's going like this the
boy is having a good time [Music] uh I'm glad

242
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,510
to see some people are enjoying the lecture

243
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:21,930
so DaoFu said as I see it the functional way
is not bound by words and speech nor is it

244
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:25,450
separate from words and speech old monk what
do you have to say

245
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:49,050
Very good! next! [Venerable XianChi begins to speak Vietnamese] I help you already, shut up

246
00:40:49,050 --> 00:41:02,840
if he's not bound by words and speech nor
it's not separate from words and speech why

247
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:09,140
does he have to open his mouth

248
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:18,930
however this is correct therefore his understanding
is superficial my skin skin deep this wisdom

249
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:29,089
here is a wisdom of enlightened person but
it is only skin deep

250
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:35,210
next ZongChi, Chi, ZongChi

251
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:44,660
hey by the way someone asked me can a woman
be enlightened

252
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:56,260
it's proof right here since Bodhidharma yes
before we don't know

253
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:03,220
maybe only Chinese women can be enlightened

254
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,280
we don't know

255
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,810
how about American women can they come and
become enlightened well we'll find out

256
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:23,550
so ZongChi said according to my understanding
see I love to see the Chinese here would the

257
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:28,950
Chinese start with according my understanding

258
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:35,079
why do you even have to say that

259
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:40,140
whatever she says doesn't it come from her
understanding or is it is he stealing from

260
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:45,990
from the old monk

261
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,910
superfluous

262
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:54,370
so clearly these first two here have a lot
of free time to kill

263
00:42:54,370 --> 00:43:03,260
uh according to my understanding

264
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:13,030
you know this is when you know us people who
work in real have real-life jobs say you're wasting

265
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:22,840
my time uh you're not getting that raise okay
it is like Ananda's glimpse of the realm

266
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:29,670
of Akshobhya Buddha seen once is never seen
again uh so apparently there has a little

267
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:42,690
bit deeper wisdom I don't know why okay anyone
understands why it's deeper than skin hmm

268
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:48,010
why

269
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:59,390
good lord you don't get it

270
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:06,660
anyone please don't embarrass me

271
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:15,490
please say something meaningful the Chinese
are watching

272
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:22,740
it's all these guys been boasting saying we're
better than us the Americans are better than

273
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:34,329
us let's see how good they are say something
smart anyone please Korea

274
00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:39,550
China I don't care

275
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:42,930
the Korean look at them

276
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,930
statues

277
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:50,700
they all look down too

278
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:58,030
it's a new style for statues you know you
know they're all from Korea when they go like

279
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:07,270
this Buddha statues are like this but no Korean
is a so when they become enlighten these people

280
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:13,300
in the future

281
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:19,319
anyone else

282
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:23,240
why is it deeper

283
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,559
why is a high level wisdom

284
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:38,180
please I beg you

285
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:42,790
yeah I'm desperate yeah go ahead and say anything
I don't care we might hit like you might get

286
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:48,809
lucky I think I remember what master said
the first time around no I never said anything

287
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:53,319
about it about this I thought you said that
something about it's just total nonsense so

288
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:57,890
she knows that it's that there's nothing to
be said because she just says nonsense boy

289
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:04,309
was I wrong did you believe that ah god I'm
glad we're redoing this because I'd be so

290
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:11,359
embarrassed if I hear anyone talk like that
oh good lord anyone else Catholic man

291
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:19,069
he's saying say I'm here to learn Buddhism
you know I don't want to watch these Buddhists

292
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:25,480
make a fool of themselves speak nonsense what
is this

293
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:35,700
here's a difference this guy still remembers

294
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:42,150
being bound by something yes this woman here
Chinese woman

295
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:48,099
does she remember anything

296
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:52,890
nothing sticks in her mind

297
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:59,369
this my guy here is still stuck on words and
speech and no words in speech this woman here

298
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:09,990
says I I saw the state of enlightenment I don't
remember a darn thing

299
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:18,470
nothing sticks

300
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:26,619
that's true emptiness nothing whatsoever

301
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:38,910
you like that same thing all the Koreans are

302
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:48,930
you like it better XianJie you like it better
very good he likes it better

303
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:58,530
okay she's high level she says

304
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:11,430
what am I supposed to understand I don't remember
there's nothing here nothing worth remembering

305
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:17,020
can you see that

306
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:29,280
well anyway and someday you understand next
has his flesh okay so skin flesh next

307
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:44,390
DaoYu, education of the way okay which is a reminder
we need to educate people okay your children

308
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:48,181
in particular have to educate them about the way

309
00:48:48,181 --> 00:48:59,910
he said see he's better already according to
my understanding he dropped it see that right

310
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:04,510
there is

311
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:15,369
improvement okay he says the four elements
are all empty okay the five skandhas are without

312
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:23,700
actual existence and I I can can someone give
me the Chinese please I don't dare touch this

313
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:30,740
unless I see the Chinese this is tricky

314
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:36,510
reload

315
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:45,530
q&a while they're reloading let's talk to
that shoot the breeze

316
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:54,640
okay remember before you say anything you
have to uh maintain the standard the wisdom

317
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:00,120
that I just elevated all of you to

318
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:06,470
see they all yeah of course

319
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:16,700
so American and the China and the Koreans
would but look at the Americans of course

320
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:33,470
yes go ahead this is just quoting the DaoYu's
words 四大本空，五陰非有，而我見處，無一法可得

321
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:35,299
okay very good let me see

322
00:50:35,299 --> 00:51:08,890
水火風本來是空的，眼耳鼻舌根也非實的，整個世界無一法可得 um um umm umm

323
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:11,760
okay

324
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:19,049
four elements are all empty

325
00:51:19,049 --> 00:51:26,010
he didn't mention five skandhas okay this
is incorrect translation you see there's no

326
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:27,740
word skandhas here

327
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:56,180
the the version that Qun found, it says 四大本空，五陰非有，而我見處，無一法可得, I think the chinese here is more the 白話文. more the. ok very good. 五陰皆什麼？五陰非有 that's more Chan!

328
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:06,720
who did this Chinese thing here has to be

329
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,580
can we know this person here does this person
have a name

330
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:25,069
huh I'm not sure who did it maybe Jane okay
I'm not sure okay uh uh

331
00:52:25,069 --> 00:52:39,390
it's not Jane someone was just adding it right now
so we can't kill this person

332
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:47,380
okay

333
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:54,530
okay very good mm-hmm yeah please don't do
the 白話 anymore okay give me the the

334
00:52:54,530 --> 00:53:02,730
actual the actual original text I'm not interested
interested in the 白話 at all can you reload it again

335
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:09,080
they changed it

336
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:15,780
I'm sure the non-Chinese people are so bored
and just give it to me anyway no you can't

337
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:21,340
give it to you yeah you have to make sure
that we learn from the Chinese wisdom first

338
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:28,970
okay let's see what Chinese wisdom what's
the level of Chinese wisdom they have here

339
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:53,430
okay so uh oh this is 簡體 oh good lord
this is mainland China person 四大本空，五陰非有，而我見處，無一法可得

340
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:59,430
okay of course I knew that this is a 見 character
I'm not that dumb

341
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:12,180
I just it's justified myself 
you know so

342
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,180
okay

343
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:22,799
okay very good okay uh so here's what it means
the four elements are all empty meaning there's

344
00:54:22,799 --> 00:54:31,700
uh there's nothing to make up this world okay
this world here as we see is made up of the

345
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:40,010
four elements okay you name anything it's
solid it's made of you know the four elements

346
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:47,970
our body is made of four elements this uh
this uh beautiful uh uh uh halloween thing

347
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:57,869
is made up of four elements okay four elements
are wood uh water what else fire and wind

348
00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:05,750
okay okay so the four elements are empty so
the wood is empty the water is empty the wind's

349
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:12,390
empty everything is empty okay because they're
empty therefore everything is that they they

350
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:18,240
that that's made up of these four elements
are empty so every are all empty so all is

351
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:26,700
empty five skandhas without actual existance
meaning there's no one there's no ego so outside

352
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:31,560
there's no world inside there's no me so
far so good

353
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:58,809
而我見處 but as I see it 無一法可得

354
00:55:58,809 --> 00:56:01,579
can be

355
00:56:01,579 --> 00:56:12,450
obtain not 得 grasp here is obtained okay
that's why this this this uh translation is

356
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:16,240
off uh

357
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:40,910
as I see you know as I see it there
isn't a single dharma to be attained

358
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:45,309
so far so good

359
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:54,819
the four elements are fundamentally empty
not all

360
00:56:54,819 --> 00:57:00,911
this is easy really this is simplified character
again right oh these Chinese people have a

361
00:57:00,911 --> 00:57:03,910
way of of of uh throwing me off

362
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:13,740
okay 五陰非有 the five skandhas

363
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:19,160
don't exist

364
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:24,339
that's the Chan terminology you want to simplify
to make it punchy like when you want to punch

365
00:57:24,339 --> 00:57:30,839
someone you want to go as fast as quickly
as possible you don't say

366
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:43,619
okay you guys don't box at all clearly neither
do I uh anyway so the five skandhas don't exist

367
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:47,369
as I see it

368
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:55,990
there is isn't a single dharma to be attained

369
00:57:55,990 --> 00:58:03,740
this is more interesting than the prior two
prior two are amateurs okay this one is pretty

370
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:07,839
good why

371
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:11,510
what he's seeing he says that

372
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:26,990
I know that the outside world is empty inside
is also empty okay but but I know as I see

373
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:40,569
it meaning I know okay 見 is that I know that
there isn't a single dharma to be obtained

374
00:58:40,569 --> 00:58:46,079
okay so he has this profound emptiness understanding

375
00:58:46,079 --> 00:59:00,289
correction it was 五陰非有 not 五蘊, 五陰, 陰陽的陰

376
00:59:00,289 --> 00:59:08,490
no no 陰 that 陰 is also skandhas the
skandhas has two words 五蘊 or 五陰

377
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:15,410
okay they both are referred to skandhas depending
on which translation version but they all

378
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:23,010
refer to 陰 here is skandhas not the 姻緣的姻
okay

379
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:30,470
this is a comment from Taiwan people don't
trust them

380
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:36,180
I can't trust the mainland China people I
can't trust Taiwanese people what's happening

381
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:42,119
in our world

382
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:53,260
okay so far so good so what does it mean he
says outside is empty inside is empty actually

383
00:59:53,260 --> 01:00:01,240
if you ask me of the entire universe there
isn't a thing

384
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:11,230
so he his vision is what and then the great
master says you attain my bones so it's deeper

385
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:18,069
so this is a deeper level wisdom why is it
deeper deeper because

386
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:30,490
the Koreans are going like this again okay
I won't ask you don't worry relax relax Koreans

387
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:39,660
anyone else oh Korean here number six I think
what he mentioned is something similar from

388
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:47,050
the Vajra sutra it's maybe it's a Vajra wiz
wisdom

389
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:56,030
they all have prajna wisdom oh okay prajna
wisdom of wisdom you know it's all prajna

390
01:00:56,030 --> 01:01:09,970
wisdom but it's the prajna wisdom has different
levels of depth okay so why is it deeper here

391
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:17,910
six uh because uh this person here has a deeper
understanding of emptiness

392
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:26,470
XianJie are you checking my old notes

393
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:30,800
check my old notes please say can you please check
my own notes see what did I say I don't want

394
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:36,180
to contradict myself

395
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:44,089
go ahead q&a it's too embarrassing why would
I contradict myself oh wow how stupid a comment

396
01:01:44,089 --> 01:01:48,220
that is

397
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:51,470
it's self-defeating 

398
01:01:51,470 --> 01:03:54,470
[Venerable XianChi speaking Vietnamese]

399
01:03:54,470 --> 01:04:00,760
no keep going keep going

400
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,330
translation and then he'll continue

401
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:13,160
so master before we go into comparison or
whatever first of all we need to understand

402
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:21,970
the term of the words what does that mean
so Buddha is mean like awareness anybody uh

403
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:28,299
sentient being all have this type of awareness
so if you pay attention you will see that

404
01:04:28,299 --> 01:04:34,680
in your mind like there will be one thought
arise and then it will disappear and then

405
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:39,609
the second thought arises and then it will
disappear but like between the two thoughts

406
01:04:19,609 --> 01:04:42,140
there will be an empty space and

407
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:43,299
that

408
01:04:43,299 --> 01:04:50,640
empty space is called um uh 如來

409
01:04:50,640 --> 01:05:02,760
如來 thus come one so everybody all
all have it and then but because we didn't

410
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:09,339
aware of it and then we keep chasing after
something else that's why it caused the affliction

411
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:17,369
and then in the great compassion repentance
in page 49 the verse is also that we and the

412
01:05:17,369 --> 01:05:24,140
Buddha all also have that but because it was
covering up so that's why we didn't aware

413
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:32,839
of it and uh so for the first two they still
see like there's an emptiness there is a person

414
01:05:32,839 --> 01:05:39,569
that attends a person there's nothing to attend
or whatever so it's similar to the blue sky

415
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:48,220
then it still have a flashing light in the
sky but then ultimately there's nothing

416
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:56,029
for you to to see and then if you can maintain
that emptiness it will be the same day and

417
01:05:56,029 --> 01:06:04,520
night that is the thus thus unmoving the
thus come one and then uh if you pay

418
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:09,761
attention to it all of us have it continue

419
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:31,240
[Venerable XianChi speak Vietnamese]

420
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:38,010
okay we're going to stop now so the the third
person she also see it but then she still

421
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:47,549
used the um the false thinking and then she
still used the words to express it so basically

422
01:06:47,549 --> 01:07:01,339
she's still not uh truly entered

423
01:07:01,339 --> 01:07:02,339
that

424
01:07:02,339 --> 01:07:46,410
[Venerable XianChi and Master speak in Vietnamese]

425
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:55,829
know your limitations

426
01:07:55,829 --> 01:08:11,390
you are in no position to comment about master
XuanHua nor master XuYun

427
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:17,299
translate that vietnamese part where I I yelled
at him I scolded him

428
01:08:17,299 --> 01:08:26,739
so master like for example in the um the morning
ceremony then and the three refugees and then

429
01:08:26,739 --> 01:08:34,350
there is a part that we say we vow that uh
all living beings will understand

430
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:44,390
the great way profoundly and bring forth the
bodhi mind so uh this is similar to to that

431
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:52,759
emptiness and then like um you know like when
master XuanHua see that Master XuYun and the master XuYun

432
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:59,710
say like uh you are like that and I'm like
that

433
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:05,040
go ahead q&a

434
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:09,700
it's okay

435
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:15,650
okay

436
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:22,589
you have to know your limitations meaning
that the reason I bring mentions one of the

437
01:09:22,589 --> 01:09:33,159
reasons why I mention certain people's levels
and so forth is to tell you that if when they're

438
01:09:33,159 --> 01:09:40,089
higher than you do not touch them because
you don't know their state don't make that

439
01:09:40,089 --> 01:09:50,509
mistake okay he said it's a state of wisdom
that I don't understand it's a proper comment

440
01:09:50,509 --> 01:09:55,800
you don't say is that's what he means what
how what do you know what he means you're

441
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:04,250
no position to comment okay say so all right

442
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,250
why is it higher

443
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:18,330
I give you a very simple explanation okay
this is a high level wisdom because see go

444
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:26,590
back to go back to the first two first one
says

445
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:38,730
words and speech are meaningless so he says
there is no words no no speech as the Chan school advocates 

446
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:39,730
okay

447
01:10:39,730 --> 01:10:43,820
言語道斷 the pathways of words and speech

448
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:55,540
are terminated is terminated so he understands
that good uh but he still use words and speech

449
01:10:55,540 --> 01:11:02,390
okay number two nun says I don't remember

450
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:08,130
very good whatever I saw I don't remember
whatever you taught me I don't remember excellent

451
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:18,659
the third guy here is go beyond goes beyond
that he says

452
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:22,920
I see

453
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:34,550
this emptiness here is huge there's nothing
there

454
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:42,140
okay it's like it's higher I use the word
high high-level wisdom it's like you go into

455
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:50,030
a high-rise building when you're low level
you can see only your neighbor's house when

456
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:57,270
you go to the tower you can see further you
can see tennis courts you can see you can

457
01:11:57,270 --> 01:12:03,530
see the freeway you can see all those things
you understand so the division is broader

458
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:11,620
that's why it says the four elements meaning
how this world is is composed is made of it's

459
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:18,190
all empty that's how I see the entire my vision
is of the entire world so my realm is bigger

460
01:12:18,190 --> 01:12:26,320
than the other two that's why it's higher
he can see further than the other two they

461
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:33,080
the other two can see emptiness but they cannot
see as far as this guy that's why venerable Bodhidharma

462
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:37,810
says you got my bones that's pretty good

463
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:52,480
does it help the Chinese avoid explaining
this okay because now you're touching you

464
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:58,300
know these people who are you are you know
who knows what level they are and you know

465
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:06,440
and and uh venerable Bodhidharma you know what he
did he teach them what dharma did he teach them

466
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:11,730
we don't know so so whatever I told you take
a grain of salt which is for fun only to make

467
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:21,810
fun of the Chinese that's all and the Indians
all right and finally HuiKe he bowed and stood

468
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:27,659
in his place you obtained my marrow Bodhidharma
says

469
01:13:27,659 --> 01:13:38,230
okay HuiKe's level is highest okay that's
why now is one of the reasons why you understand

470
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:46,080
that venerable Bodhidharma made him kneel for
nine years because those nine years prepared

471
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:59,550
him to have a deeper understanding than sitting
in full lotus

472
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:09,870
now you see there's a proof right there level
the level of HuiKe is very very high

473
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:21,190
okay meaning that venerable Bodhidharama's level
is extremely extremely high much higher than

474
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,260
HuiKe

475
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:35,190
there's what because the level of understand
HuiKe is is incredible

476
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:45,790
okay and that's why venerable Bodhidharma
said this is as deep as my dharma can go

477
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:53,909
this is as deep as my dharma can penetrate
you

478
01:14:53,909 --> 01:14:59,550
that's a very high compliment

479
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:06,850
okay this is how Chan people compliment their
students you don't say oh you're such a wonderful

480
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:13,800
student you're so so why you're so smart you're
so handsome no you're my bone marrow

481
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:32,880
yeah southerner no do you have a question
in conch you see XianAn is sleeping he's uh

482
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:43,620
I don't know what they're talking about it's
too much for me go ahead conch I bet you he

483
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:49,880
dyed his hair I don't believe him

484
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:54,150
different lighting in JMT no no no no

485
01:15:54,150 --> 01:16:00,510
master when you said you have my bones you have my marrow what does that mean like I am you what what do we say well liar liar

486
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:11,050
or whatever what what is that that yeah liar liar
pants on fire

487
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:16,199
translate that into Korean

488
01:16:16,199 --> 01:16:23,960
Chinese see if you can translate that into
Chinese

489
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,260
liar liar pants on fire

490
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:36,750
I see they don't get it only Americans get
it okay go ahead sorry uh fire hair

491
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:46,750
yes is it working yeah master when he said
when he said um you have my bones and you

492
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:52,880
have my marrow what does that mean like I
am you I'm the same as you no no no it's not

493
01:16:52,880 --> 01:17:02,200
the same he says it refers to skin deep wisdom
muscle deep wisdom bone deep wisdom and inside

494
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:06,300
the bone that's it that's the deepest

495
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:16,800
okay and that's amazing because because uh
because by the time Bodhidharma left HuiKe

496
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:25,840
attained a very very high level and what's
amazing is that he didn't have a lot of disciples

497
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:32,340
after that that's what's surprising to me
at his level he should have a lot of eminent

498
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:35,489
disciples

499
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:37,500
okay

500
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:43,719
but he didn't that's what is baffling to me
now I look at this and says how come he didn't

501
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:51,199
have a lot more eminent disciples like the
sixth patriarch why not I mean you know he

502
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:59,420
at that level he's an incredible teacher let
me assure you I feel he's most incredible teacher

503
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:10,280
and yet his disciples weren't there meaning
that maybe the Chinese you know weren't available

504
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:18,460
or something we don't know but to me it's
amazing that venerable Bodhidharma transmitted

505
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:27,600
his knowledge to HuiKe and and we're very
very lucky that venerable HuiKe's level is extremely

506
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:38,560
high and that's why uh that's why the knowledge
uh to me that's that that's a kind of proof

507
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:49,030
that the great dharma was transmitted to China
back then it's for real

508
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:54,679
okay and what I don't understand again is
that how come at that level he didn't have

509
01:18:54,679 --> 01:19:02,469
that many more disciples so that Buddhism
in China would prosper a lot quicker I don't

510
01:19:02,469 --> 01:19:10,340
understand that that's amazing number nine
this is from Jane liar liar pants on fire

511
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:24,270
in chinese is translated into 騙子騙子褲子著火 [Laughter] I like that translation

512
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:33,310
the pants on fire yeah okay very good Korean
translation how did we do in Korean translation

513
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:46,210
hey Korean translator uh speak it out so that
we can correct you

514
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:55,210
say it loud we're double checking the Korean
translator

515
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:58,810
very good yeah

516
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:10,340
this woman here is so hard to get any word
out of her

517
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:11,340
see still

518
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:30,650
master do you hear me no I can't hear you
I don't know how to translate it

519
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:38,710
okay never mind okay so it's very good so
this is this is so fantastic that that uh

520
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:45,929
that um that when venerable HuiKe uh attained really
attained the sudden teaching dharma from

521
01:20:45,929 --> 01:20:55,790
venerable Bodhidharma on 53 Bodhidharma recited
the this poem originally I came to this land

522
01:20:55,790 --> 01:21:02,909
to rescue the deluded by transmitted dharma
one flower will open in five petals with five

523
01:21:02,909 --> 01:21:26,170
petals and the fruit will ripen by itself
吾本來茲土，傳法救迷情，一花開五葉，結果自然成. so venerable Bodhidharma recited this poem

524
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:37,160
not sure whether it's Chinese or or or in
Sanskrit or whatever but he says I he got

525
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:43,909
I think he got he got a little bit emotional
he says original I came to this land looking

526
01:21:43,909 --> 01:21:50,000
back I came to this land, what for to rescue
the deluded by transmitting the dharma to

527
01:21:50,000 --> 01:22:00,020
rescue all these deluded Chinese people okay
and I transmit the dharma to my successor

528
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:09,670
and in the future one flower will open with
five petals okay so five beautiful uh manifestations

529
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:18,300
uh five beautiful components of the great
Chan dharma the five schools maybe and the fruit

530
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:28,330
will ripen by itself okay and meaning what
what does it mean the fruit by ripening itself

531
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:32,140
Chinese people Indian people we don't have
any Indian people do we

532
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:35,960
no Indian people

533
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:46,699
hmm we should be more open-minded and welcome
more Indians uh what does it mean the fruit

534
01:22:46,699 --> 01:23:00,639
will be we or will be ripen by itself

535
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:01,639
yes Diego

536
01:23:01,639 --> 01:23:15,719
seven uh maybe I think it's that the patriarch
will get like in a higher level just by itself

537
01:23:15,719 --> 01:23:22,130
without the necessity of a master at that
time

538
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:24,000
yeah close enough yes six

539
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:37,620
eventually the transmission of dharma will
be successfully um given to the Chinese yeah

540
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:47,320
okay basically he says my job is done

541
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:56,510
you guys just uh I don't know where you're
from but it's so clear to me I'm done here

542
01:23:56,510 --> 01:24:05,720
I'm out of here isn't that we Americans do
I say I'm done hallelujah free at last free

543
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:12,239
at last thank god I'm free at last huh

544
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:18,530
because he's like remember he sat there for
nine years is he gonna leave or what

545
01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:31,130
HuiKe refused to leave for nine years so
finally I'm done the fruit will ripen by itself

546
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:37,909
there's no need for for me to do anything
anymore because it takes it will take care

547
01:24:37,909 --> 01:24:42,330
of itself

548
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:52,070
okay I'm done I'm out of here but the Indians
don't speak like we do

549
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:57,260
all right

550
01:24:57,260 --> 01:25:06,469
fifty-four three years after Bodhidharma's
death ambassador SongYun of northern Wei

551
01:25:06,469 --> 01:25:12,719
is said to have seen him walking while holding
a shoe at premier heights somewhere in India

552
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:21,280
I guess okay so he saw Bodhidharma it could
be real could be a vision we don't know SongYun

553
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:28,239
asked Bodhidharma where he was going
to which Bodhidharma replied I'm going home

554
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:33,870
so apparently some kind of ambassador saw
him between the borders the border region

555
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:39,100
this area here between India and China so
yes where are you going you went to China

556
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:48,870
or India so he says I'm going home okay and
55 and why you're holding your shoes

557
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:55,840
Bodhidharma says you will know when you reach Shaolin
monastery don't mention you saw me or you will

558
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:03,030
meet with disaster and after arriving at palace
soon told him emperor he met Bodhidharma on

559
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:16,020
the way [Laughter] don't trust Chinese people

560
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:25,570
emperors said Bodhidharma is already dead
and buried and SongYun arrested for lying [Laughter]

561
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:28,120
serves him right [Laughter] sorry

562
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:39,510
I told you I have no compassion whatsoever
even for historical personalities yes sir

563
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:47,530
number seven so I I imagine that in the future
when the master is done he will be seen walking

564
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:59,659
in the Bahamas [Laughter] what a prediction

565
01:26:59,659 --> 01:27:04,580
praise the lord

566
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:10,909
and at Shaolin monastery monks informed them
that Bodhidharma was dead had been buried

567
01:27:10,909 --> 01:27:16,739
buried in a hill behind the temple okay

568
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:24,699
and the monks then said master has gone back
home and prostrated three times for nine years

569
01:27:24,699 --> 01:27:31,969
he had remained and nobody knew him carrying
a shoe in hand he went home quietly without

570
01:27:31,969 --> 01:27:35,090
ceremony

571
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:43,199
okay probably some kind of verse here okay
uh anyway it's Chinese monk so who cares what

572
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:50,199
they say okay uh and this is Bodhidharma being
depressed and said when is he gonna leave

573
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:54,380
me alone

574
01:27:54,380 --> 01:28:05,260
and you see how he did not even sit in full
lotus he says I'm not teaching him nothing

575
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:16,489
I hope he leaves soon but he refuses to leave
and the the skull is interesting to me anyway

576
01:28:16,489 --> 01:28:25,760
uh 59 second patriarch okay HuiKe was born
to family of Taoist scholars in what is now

577
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:34,730
Henan province china about 60 miles east
of Luoyang and that's a capital and a bit north

578
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:41,320
of the sacred mountain of SongShan

579
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:48,140
a sacred mountain SongShan that's uh I don't
know probably Shaolin temple when he was born

580
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:56,909
his parents saw WeiTuo Bodhisattva golden armored spiritual
protector come to offer protection not offer

581
01:28:56,909 --> 01:29:03,639
protection came and stand in guard I don't
know who made this translation here it's not

582
01:29:03,639 --> 01:29:15,230
offer protection WeiTuo came and stood in guard
okay there upon in 60 they named their son ShenGuang

583
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:23,750
which means spiritual light and that's from
WeiTuo Bodhisattva's light not only was a patriarch

584
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:30,820
intelligent but he has an excellent memory
as well and his skills and power of discrimination

585
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:36,850
was so remarkable that he could read 10 lines
in the time it took an ordinary person to

586
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:46,409
read one okay you have these strange traits
manifestations okay of of remarkable individuals

587
01:29:46,409 --> 01:29:59,119
61 in a gathering 100 people all talking at
once he could clearly distinguish each conversation

588
01:29:59,119 --> 01:30:05,530
that's impressive that's a very high processing
power is that would you say it's like a tensor

589
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:11,430
chip or m1 or m2x or whatever in today's power

590
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:23,030
no oh you don't keep up with iphones and uh
pixel

591
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:28,719
ummm boring

592
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:38,840
however had great anger he disagreed with
everyone was always ready to fight asura

593
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:44,119
okay

594
01:30:44,119 --> 01:30:51,960
as a young man HuiKe also studied Confucianism
along with Taoism so this is a erudite he

595
01:30:51,960 --> 01:31:00,300
is well read very good because when you want
to teach you need to have comparative things

596
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:05,910
we teach worldly people you need to know where
they're coming from and back then the worldly

597
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:11,930
wisdom is being consists of Confucianism
and Taoism there was the highest level of

598
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:17,570
wisdom in china back then so he had to prepare
himself now you're listening boys and girls

599
01:31:17,570 --> 01:31:29,260
you want to teach later you have to learn
about worldly wisdom okay eventually not yet

600
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:31,410
give yourself time I'm not dead yet

601
01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:42,100
the deaths of his parents cause HuiKe to turn
to Buddhism why could not find the answer

602
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:57,980
okay Buddhism has very profound insights into
death that the other doctrines do not

603
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:06,719
all right so at in 519 when he was 32 years
old he became a Buddhist monk in a temple

604
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:16,159
near Luoyang ancient capital about eight years
later he left in search of Bodhidharma so he

605
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:26,369
became a monk okay and he was well read well
educated person and of course he read a lot

606
01:32:26,369 --> 01:32:35,340
of Buddhist scriptures okay and wasn't long
before he was able to lecture on Buddhist

607
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:41,060
scriptures see back then

608
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:48,949
important point they did not have Chan at
all that is why it was considered back then

609
01:32:48,949 --> 01:32:56,230
that Mahayana was not quite in China yet

610
01:32:56,230 --> 01:33:05,520
okay in other words Mahayana needs the backbone
of

611
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:14,220
Chan that's why Bodhidharma had to come to
China in order to transmit specifically this

612
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:24,800
dharma door called Chan okay so that's why
even though you could lecture it's basically

613
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,980
scholarly stuff

614
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:35,710
all due respect to the scholars they put a
lot of work blood and sweat into their acquisition

615
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:49,590
of Buddhist knowledge but the knowledge is
hair pore deep not even skin yet hasn't penetrated

616
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:57,409
the world of wisdom yet so far so good

617
01:33:57,409 --> 01:34:07,869
and so uh 32 years he became a monk and eight
years later so this guy is very very sharp

618
01:34:07,869 --> 01:34:14,730
he decided to

619
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:17,260
follow

620
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:27,920
great master Bodhidharma okay and he was about
40 years old okay so he started the age of

621
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:37,010
40. wow there's hope for you after all huh
most of you are like in your 40s aren't you

622
01:34:37,010 --> 01:34:39,740
and the girl said yeah yeah that's me

623
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:55,880
no you're not 40. don't laugh you must be
around close to 60 I would say

624
01:34:55,880 --> 01:35:09,780
60 uh he obeyed his teacher and went to hiding
for 40 years oh wow so 40 to 49 okay and then

625
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:17,310
he studied under Bodhidharma for some more
years so let's say five six years okay so

626
01:35:17,310 --> 01:35:27,330
it's 54 55 and then went to hiding for 40
years so he's about 100 years oh wow that's

627
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:35,610
too much no so clearly my master Bodhidharma
didn't teach him much okay because when he

628
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:42,310
was 80 he began to propagate the Buddha dharma
okay meaning that he hid for 40 years he he

629
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:49,520
uh he um he was around 40 when he became enlightened
okay

630
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:59,679
you know when he started so 40 49 years when
are you how can the math doesn't add up i

631
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:06,840
don't I don't get it this doesn't add up it's
a chinese arithmetic for us it doesn't add

632
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:13,489
up okay but anyway let's not worry about this
you know this detail it's not that important

633
01:36:13,489 --> 01:36:23,489
okay whether it's 100 years or 200 years who
cares okay and he started at 80 years old

634
01:36:23,489 --> 01:36:29,290
he began to propagate the Buddha dharma teaching
and transforming living beings while 80 years

635
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:38,030
old that's impressive 80 years let's see probably
had to use a cane q&a

636
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:51,280
Emituofo master in the history saying that
the Bodhidharma

637
01:36:51,280 --> 01:37:02,750
went to China in the in the um fifth and between
the fifth and the sixth century 502 to about

638
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:16,790
550 something but then the XuanZang dharma
master who went to India to get Buddhism or

639
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:28,090
to get Buddhist texts to translate in the
early 600s meaning only 50 years after Bodhidharma

640
01:37:28,090 --> 01:37:41,530
so so meaning after Bodhidharma passed away
the the Chan sect is not really uh

641
01:37:41,530 --> 01:37:44,060
popular yet no

642
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:47,469
until like six patriarch in order

643
01:37:47,469 --> 01:37:56,179
yes it's not until the fourth and fifth patriarch that's when it used to have thousands of people
cultivating oh I see okay yeah thank you back

644
01:37:56,179 --> 01:38:02,300
then there weren't a lot of people okay I
weren't a lot of people who were willing to

645
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:08,340
kneel for nine years

646
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:12,719
okay

647
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:22,030
all right uh later disciples of Bodhiruci
another famous eminent monk back then and

648
01:38:22,030 --> 01:38:32,210
Vinaya master Kuang Tung tried to kill him
he who and so he feigns insanity to uh to

649
01:38:32,210 --> 01:38:38,350
uh uh to fool them but he never ceases
to save living beings who were ready to receive

650
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:45,780
his teaching okay patriarchs uh when you hear
these stories who would want to be a patriarch

651
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:49,619
it's a lot of work a lot of grief and no reward
okay

652
01:38:49,619 --> 01:38:57,780
62 that's his parents oh why did I go back
sorry

653
01:38:57,780 --> 01:38:59,969
uh

654
01:38:59,969 --> 01:39:11,790
64. thank you about 534 northern Wei dynasty
they had rural northern China collapsed under

655
01:39:11,790 --> 01:39:18,310
the weight of riots and revolts and northern
China was split into two kingdoms new dynasties

656
01:39:18,310 --> 01:39:29,100
dynasties seized power and soon met with violent
ends from to 557-581 much northern China not

657
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:32,429
California was ruled by the northern Zhou
dynasty

658
01:39:32,429 --> 01:39:44,260
all right 65 the northern Zhou emperor Wu who were persuaded
that Buddhism has become too powerful and

659
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:53,810
in 574 and 577 he attempted to abolish Buddhism
in his kingdom and the patriarch HuiKe had

660
01:39:53,810 --> 01:40:02,790
to flee south he found a hiding place in mountains
of southern AnHui province near the Yangtze

661
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:03,790
river

662
01:40:03,790 --> 01:40:11,099
well it's yeah it's a lot of hardship now
you know why there weren't a lot of followers

663
01:40:11,099 --> 01:40:18,010
because he's running for his life and hiding
most of the time uh 66 according to the scholars

664
01:40:18,010 --> 01:40:25,770
today on a mountain name uh how why how come
the two "s" Sukungshan there's a stone platform

665
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:32,679
on which uh it is said that HuiKe lectured and
the boulder it is said that marked a place where

666
01:40:32,679 --> 01:40:47,929
Huike pass bodhidharma's robe and bowl the successor SengCan
SengCān cán or càn, càn càn càn càn càn 

667
01:40:47,929 --> 01:40:55,449
in time a very elderly HuiKe returned to north
China he told his students he had to repay

668
01:40:55,449 --> 01:41:05,179
a karmic debt a day 199 593 a famous monk
named him called him of heresy accused him

669
01:41:05,179 --> 01:41:12,139
of heresy not name him okay accuse him of
a heresy the emperor ordered the district

670
01:41:12,139 --> 01:41:19,619
magistrate to arrest him and the patriarch
was locked up and questioned are you human

671
01:41:19,619 --> 01:41:27,430
are you a freak asked the magistrate I'm a freak
replied HuiKe magistrate knew the patriarch

672
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:33,429
said this to avoid causing jealousy so he ordered him to tell the truth speak

673
01:41:33,429 --> 01:41:41,040
clearly what are you uh I am a freak replied HuiKe
the Buddha dharma will not flourish until the

674
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:51,070
time of forth patriarch he announced then he was
executed he cut his head off instead of blood

675
01:41:51,070 --> 01:42:00,840
a white milky uh milky white liquid flowed
into the chopping block must eat a lot of

676
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:07,110
this white cheese thing the emperor knew they
had executed a sage because you remember the

677
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:15,310
24th indian patriarch Aryasimha had also
been beheaded and had not bled but white milky

678
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:20,910
liquid had poured forth because he had been
without outflows when no one has ignorance

679
01:42:20,910 --> 01:42:27,340
one may attain may attend to a state without
outflows they enter the white Yang realm so

680
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:37,810
the blood becomes white wow that's too much
so can you imagine go to Kaiser hospital

681
01:42:37,810 --> 01:42:38,830
and try to give blood

682
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:57,210
uh you go ahead seven master is your blood
red or white my blood is red hot

683
01:42:57,210 --> 01:43:06,220
because of the anger issues

684
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:18,820
71 realizing he was a bodhisattva in the flesh
emperor felt great shame a bodhisattva had came to

685
01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:31,410
our country he said and instead of offering
him protection we killed him excuse me

686
01:43:31,410 --> 01:43:38,349
and the emperor had all the great officials
take refuge with this strange Bhikshu political

687
01:43:38,349 --> 01:43:43,840
thing you know a real politician you know
this is great sage let's all take refuge

688
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:49,200
with him even though he's dead

689
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:59,389
and the name they gave themselves their own
dharma names

690
01:43:59,389 --> 01:44:07,929
letter to student by Dr. Suzuki translation you
have truly comprehended the dharma as it is

691
01:44:07,929 --> 01:44:14,639
the deepest truth lies oh my god I want I
need chinese I need chinese oh yeah yeah these

692
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:22,619
people are not qualified to translate uh Chan
texts but that's see what else see

693
01:44:22,619 --> 01:44:29,449
if you can find it please anyway I can't understand
when it's more than one sentence

694
01:44:29,449 --> 01:44:36,760
I struggle it is due to one's ignorance that
the mani-jewel is taken from piece of brick for

695
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:41,969
a piece of brick but when one is suddenly
awakened to self-enlightenment is realize

696
01:44:41,969 --> 01:44:50,790
that one is in possession or real jewel oh
yeah yeah yeah what a boring stuff I'd rather

697
01:44:50,790 --> 01:44:58,909
have some cold noodles than reading this the
ignorant and the enlighted are of one essence they are

698
01:44:58,909 --> 01:45:05,449
not really to be separated who asks you to
be separate oh god lord I mean it says they

699
01:45:05,449 --> 01:45:12,330
contradict themselves they want essence they
are not really to be separated who asks you

700
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:20,260
we should know that all things are such as
they are who cares

701
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:23,650
tell me how to get rich

702
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:29,270
those no no no actually it doesn't sound right
tell me how to get a bigger temple those who

703
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:33,760
entertain a dualistic view of the world are
to be pitied that I write this letter for them

704
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:43,219
who's this HuiKe okay he came from saying
nothing to being very verbose

705
01:45:43,219 --> 01:45:51,460
what happened old age he lost his marbles

706
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:55,420
I write this letter for them when I know that
between this body and the Buddha there is

707
01:45:55,420 --> 01:46:01,270
nothing to separate one from the other what
is the use of seeking after nirvana something

708
01:46:01,270 --> 01:46:10,820
is turning ourselves it's too verbose like
the old monk here our old monk

709
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:17,449
okay any questions about venerable Huike he's
an extraordinary individual I'm I'm so I'm

710
01:46:17,449 --> 01:46:27,659
I'm so happy that we discovered that is his
uh it's uh he's uh he he got a lot from venerable Bodhidharma's

711
01:46:27,659 --> 01:46:37,219
teaching and so that's why Chinese Buddhism
was in good hands when Bodhidharma left now

712
01:46:37,219 --> 01:46:47,349
you understand why Bodhidharma left
because he knew that he's no longer needed

713
01:46:47,349 --> 01:46:52,010
you understand they don't waste time they
stick around only because they are needed they're

714
01:46:52,010 --> 01:46:53,239
not needed they go home

715
01:46:53,239 --> 01:47:11,409
all right questions comments

716
01:47:11,409 --> 01:47:15,449
we are

717
01:47:15,449 --> 01:47:27,650
learning about this to appreciate the depth
of Chinese Buddhism it started with the second

718
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:39,050
Chinese patriarch HuiKe okay very very impressive
Chinese monk okay uh what happened

719
01:47:39,050 --> 01:47:50,000
oh in simplified again oh my god you guys
are just want the end of me

720
01:47:50,000 --> 01:48:07,349
the student is not very bright is he that's
why it's so verbose okay not interest not interested

721
01:48:07,349 --> 01:48:17,340
in this letter at all sorry yeah next a few
more minutes any questions uh all right let's

722
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:27,849
see what kind of patriarch venerable SengCàn cān or cán cān. 

723
01:48:27,849 --> 01:48:35,060
SengCàn SengCàn

724
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:44,490
okay 
look at him

725
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:47,940
love the nose

726
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:52,941
what do you call the kind of nose you physionomist
Chinese physiologist is that a good nose or

727
01:48:52,941 --> 01:49:03,840
a bad nose nevermind 77 little known about
him transmission of the lamp the records there produced

728
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:06,619
in a song dynasty by uh 釋道原

729
01:49:06,619 --> 01:49:13,310
author of famous Chan poem

730
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:26,780
信心銘 okay inscription on the mind of faith okay
so

731
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:38,409
not much okay but he produces Chan poem called
信心銘 okay and uh and uh inscription

732
01:49:38,409 --> 01:49:45,219
on the mind of faith uh that's he composed
that when he first came to visit the second

733
01:49:45,219 --> 01:49:52,849
second patriarch his body is recovered with repulsive
sore like those are a leper oh yuk where

734
01:49:52,849 --> 01:49:58,949
are you from asked the second patriarch what are
you doing here

735
01:49:58,949 --> 01:50:03,560
I have come to take refuge to the high master
and study and cultivate the Buddha Dharma

736
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:11,960
answers SengCan you have loathsome disease
and your body is filthy how can you study

737
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:20,469
the Buddha Dharma 79 SengCan said I'm a sick
man you are a high master he said but in our

738
01:50:20,469 --> 01:50:27,290
true minds where is the difference there upon
the second patriarch transmitted a dharma to

739
01:50:27,290 --> 01:50:33,830
him saying this rope and bowl have been passed
on from Bodhidharma they certify that you

740
01:50:33,830 --> 01:50:39,210
have received the dharma seal

741
01:50:39,210 --> 01:50:47,719
that's all the training no nine years [Laughter]
what's going on this simplified too much I'm

742
01:50:47,719 --> 01:50:52,730
worried now about the third generation

743
01:50:52,730 --> 01:51:01,619
is it for real really that's it

744
01:51:01,619 --> 01:51:08,150
so easy that way I want to become
a patriarch too in order to protect it you

745
01:51:08,150 --> 01:51:14,560
must go into hiding because Bodhiruchi's followers
will try to harm you be very careful and let

746
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:16,770
no one know that you have received transmission

747
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:30,040
SengCan asked HuiKe saying I'm diseased I implore
you to cleanse me of my offenses

748
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:39,679
what did he do 81 HuiKe says said bring me
your offense I will cleanse it for you

749
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:46,889
i cleanse you of it oh yeah yeah

750
01:51:46,889 --> 01:51:50,869
cleanse you of it

751
01:51:50,869 --> 01:51:56,389
it's gotta be Chinglish

752
01:51:56,389 --> 01:52:04,639
SengCan thought for a while and said I
cannot get at

753
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:05,639
it

754
01:52:05,639 --> 01:52:14,820
覓罪不可得 close enough, that's okay

755
01:52:14,820 --> 01:52:22,130
HuiKe replied then I have cleansed uh you of it should
live by the Buddha dharma and sangha okay

756
01:52:22,130 --> 01:52:28,480
well that's a nice way of cleansing the all
the illnesses let's try that sometimes

757
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:38,610
83 I can see you as a monk a member of the
Buddhist community what are the Buddha and

758
01:52:38,610 --> 01:52:51,969
the teaching all of a sudden now there is Chinese I'm confused
84. this mind is Buddha this mind is a teaching

759
01:52:51,969 --> 01:53:00,010
the teaching and Buddha are not separate this
is also true of the sangha not the community

760
01:53:00,010 --> 01:53:18,829
oh good lord change it to sangha okay 是心是佛， 是心是法

761
01:53:18,829 --> 01:53:23,949
法佛無二，僧寶亦然

762
01:53:23,949 --> 01:53:37,040
huh the Dharma is not teaching the mind is
the Dharma the Dharma Dharma and Buddha are

763
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:49,449
not two don't say separate two

764
01:53:49,449 --> 01:53:57,270
and the sangha jewel so is a sangha jewel
okay anyway it doesn't matter it's not a Chan thing

765
01:53:57,270 --> 01:54:03,420
so who cares

766
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:11,230
okay it doesn't do much for the people who
read it okay it's not meant as instruction

767
01:54:11,230 --> 01:54:15,810
for you to become enlightened so who cares
okay why waste time on this

768
01:54:15,810 --> 01:54:27,710
okay did you fix it okay there you go very
fast very good 85. today for the first time

769
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:34,400
I have realized that the essence of offense
is not inside not outside not in between so

770
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:38,900
it is also a mind

771
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:43,679
the Buddha and teaching are not separate either

772
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:45,880
who is he teaching against sorry I forgot

773
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:55,720

775
01:55:03,659 --> 01:55:08,590
what are the Buddha and the sangha okay and
uh this mind Buddha is mind is Dharma and

776
01:55:08,590 --> 01:55:15,329
the Dharma Buddha are not two so is a sangha
jewel very good for the first time you realize

777
01:55:15,329 --> 01:55:19,790
essence of offense are and the Dharma are uh

778
01:55:19,790 --> 01:55:40,010
um 佛法無也

779
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:45,440
there's no Buddha there's no Dharma

780
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:53,119
what is it Buddha and the teaching as separate
either oh good lord the Chinese says Buddha

781
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:56,630

782
01:55:56,630 --> 01:56:01,639
oc french excuse me

783
01:56:01,639 --> 01:56:13,380
I heard that Abba broke up again I know it

shaved his head SengCan cultivated under the

788
01:56:49,090 --> 01:56:54,920
second patriarch his illness gradually improved

789
01:56:54,920 --> 01:57:00,159
that's what happens when you're sick you became
a monk and you know good things happen okay

790
01:57:00,159 --> 01:57:09,719
and that's natural by the way if it doesn't
happen you don't improve uh change temples

791

HuiKe gave robe and bowl two years later wow

SengCan instruction not to teach publicly

797

because of impending danger uh predicted by
27th patriarch uh Prajnatara uh third patriarch feigned

806
01:58:53,900 --> 01:59:00,410
after transmitting dharma to the fourth patriarch 道信

807
01:59:00,410 --> 01:59:11,949
