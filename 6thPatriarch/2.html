<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=454">00:07:34</a> |  hello everyone thank you all for coming it's nice to see you today is the 30th of october 2021 and we are continuing to discuss the sixth patriarch sutra we're starting over we're on slide number 45. <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=475">00:07:55</a> |  thank you very much okay. so in in the midst of the story between bodhidharma and how he transmitted chan to the second patriarch, the um the um uh this uh second patriarch venerable HuiKe okay, before he was ShenGuang, ShenGuang is his dharma name, but then after he became second patriarch venerable bodhidharma was very kind and gave him a dharma name, and that's what he used. um uh so uh so after after the uh after venerable HuiKe became enlightened, and he went through a lot of hardship, uh imagine yourself having to kneel for nine hours, I mean nine years sorry, not hours nine hours pretty easy, uh nine years all day okay. and back then I don't think they invented the full lotus posture yet, no i'm kidding i thought I think full lotus came from india, but in china I think it's probably the case where uh the chinese didn't believe in full lotus, and that's why he made them kneel for nine years, he said see how tough you chinese people are. and after that HuiKe up knew better, I said oh we better learn teach Chinese how to do full lotus, because I don't think anyone would be stupid enough like me to kneel for nine years like this okay. it's extraordinary of a feat you see this this uh this monk here, was uh extraordinary of a monk okay, and extraordinary people moved through extraordinary extraordinarily difficult tasks, so don't complain you know. I said I'm too sleepy and sit in full lotus, then get up and kneel for nine years you're such a wimp okay. uh so uh this is so so anyway so HuiKe when venerable HuiKe, second patriarch HuiKe uh had to prove himself for nine years, before master Bodhidharma decided to teach him. so after he taught HuiKe, taught him the sudden teaching dharma, he named him HuiKe, meaning wise and able. uh Hui(慧) here is refers to prajna wisdom okay, meaning that he's certified HuiKe as the first chinese monk to have prajna wisdom, that's why hui comes first not last okay. Ke(可) here refers that uh he's able to carry on the burden of propagating Mahayana, he's able to carry on the transmission of this wonderful sudden teaching Dharma door all right, so oh that's a word of encouragement, i deem you worthy so carry on. and um and uh so HuiKe asked great master Bodhidharma: in india do you transmit the dharma to your disciples? did you also give robe and bowl as certification okay? <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=760">00:12:40</a> |  and 46 uh Bodhidharma replied I transmitted the dharma in India, of course what do you think, it's just like just like you just gave it to us right? I mean you know, not the Indians right, your own kind, we better right? uh there's a little bit of racism in here if I I think, and so Bodhidharma has to say: yes of course I transmitted the Dharma, I taught the sudden teaching in India as well, but I did not use a robe and bowl, Indian people are straightforward to attain fruition, they know they must be certified, that comes from the tradition from the great first patriarch Indian patriarch Mahākāśyapa okay, if no one certifies them they do not say I have attained the way, I have given proof to arhatship, I am a bodhisattva okay. so he's saying that the you Chinese people are not as straightforward as the Indian back then, that is not the case anymore unfortunately. <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=841">00:14:01</a> | uh and unfortunately the Chinese tend to lie, it's probably translation error you know you know, you don't want to bring the Dharma to Chinese, say you are a bunch of liars. many claim sagehood although they fully know they aren't, that's what Indians do by the way, it's not just the Chinese, Indians do that too nowadays. therefore I transmit the robe and bowl to prove that you have received transmission, in other words there's only one robe and bowl ever gave to the Indian, I'm not going to give it to you, so uh I said oh that's uh the answer, and that's the completes the cycle of certification, so we certified uh that HuiKe was enlightened and then he also uh uh gave him the robe and bowl as well okay, and that's uh happy ending uh story. uh and venerable Bodhidharma, according to master XuanHua, was poisoned six times, some of them were really famous Chinese monks, Indian monks, his contemporaries. and that's comes with the job okay, you you do something important, uh the uh your peers are your worst enemies okay, uh and and that's the nature of the Chinese competition, they can't beat you they poison you, I take it back, uh not the Chinese, and the monks in general, if they can't compete with you, they do things to uh destroy you, to harm you, uh and that's the way it is okay. yeah you don't like it, don't be patriarch, stop complaining.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=982">00:16:22</a> |   uh so and and uh venerable Bodhidharma also gave a prediction, he says: why am I doing this I'm doing this not only to give this to you this precious Dharma here okay I do this because you are just a vehicle just a bridge for the propagation for the Dharma to be propagated to future generations where there will be the case one flower opens uh the five petals um okay uh this refers to the fact in the future that there is a a monk by the name of MaZu well very famous very competent Chinese patriarch who then had five eminent disciples okay and from his uh that uh that learned from him and later uh did great things for the Chan school and for Mahayana in general so venerable Bodhidharama says you know you make sure that you pass on this knowledge because uh there's a in the future you need this bloodline this transmission to go to future generations so that it will blossom eventually okay that's the way it has to be in China back then Q&A<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=1087">00:18:07</a> |  go ahead uh quick question master why did Bodhidharma make venerable HuiKe kneel for nine years before telling him to wait until the snow turns red why not just tell him wait at the very beginning wait until the snow turns red yeah I could have said oh yeah yeah oh yeah uh he could have said you know in the future in nine years later there is uh the Dharma will be transmitted somehow so you hang in there right no it turns out that uh I don't know because I cannot speak for master Bodhidharma okay Bodhidharma is is a great great sage from India okay so uh and and and you can tell it's a great sage because uh he went through a lot of hardship and he he his hardship proved that great men walked the difficult paths that's what makes them great it's never easy for these people okay so he uh he he um he taught this Chinese guy who did not sit in full lotus okay so uh so this part of this nine years here is to help him understand that in order to become enlightened you must endure suffering if you are not willing to endure suffering you will not become enlightened so if you know and and you can imagine do you you think that HuiKe when he was great master HuiKe when he was kneeling behind Bodhidharma did he say oh ouch ouch out there's mosquito here master master okay it's raining can we stop can we can we take a break I'm having a I have a cold today I think it covid 17. so you see they went through a lot you we only see it as nine years actually they went through so much okay so many things occur that was not even worthy to be recorded and the simple thing is just you kneel there for nine years see if you can do that see how many people can do that okay uh and and that's what enabled HuiKe to be ready for the transmission okay so according to venerable Bodhidharma conditions were that that's what he felt that HuiKe was has to go through for for nine years basically the test is that aren't you gonna give up every day aren't you going to give up China's Chinese person are you going to give up and what did HuiKe have to work with nothing he has no fourty two hands and eyes remember he's a dharma master he lectures on sutras he doesn't know how to cultivate didn't have any great compassion mantra didn't have any Buddha's name to recite have no Medicine Master Buddha blessings see how weak you are you have all those things HuiKe had nothing whatsoever so what did he have how did he survive<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=1396">00:23:16</a> |  you think with Covid and you know SARS and you know going around the country you know and hunger and pain in the legs in the back aches sleepiness Q&A what do you have to work with Q&A okay master I think like the fact that master HuiKe can kneel for nine years because before that there was the ghost the impermanent ghost came and then say that okay it's time for you to die and then he was asking like is there any way that I can get help or can you wait for me and then they give him a tips like the monk that you uh knock down two teeth he's the one that already escaped birth and death so HuiKe he has no other way to turn so that that's why he has to kneel for nine years to wait for Bodhidharma to teach him and rescue him from the death and then the patriarch YinGuang he also say that if you want to be uh vigorous you just have to think that the death is coming so that is one way to help you to be vigorous and work hard and then for me the price he has to pay to kneel for nine years like uh because of the offenses he beat up on the arhat and then just nine years that is a very cheap uh light punishment otherwise he will be fall into the um the hell and stay there forever very good good answer that's it yeah exactly in summary what's this alternative if he quits what's going to happen he dies so he has no choice but to hang in there okay and so he uh he had to somehow find a way to survive okay and he cannot afford he cannot afford to quit that's why so that's which brings to mind uh a recently a disciple of mine she says<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=1625">00:27:05</a> |  you know I got so much out of the chan Dharma door here it does wonders for me but I don't know how I can uh share with my colleagues I know they need it desperately but I don't know how I can share it with them okay and then I didn't say anything but the answer is what oh monk see if you can do it again he was he relaxes oh I hit I hit the bull's eye so I can relax no I came right back at him no time to relax HuiKe who has to do for nine years in a row you can't relax caught red-handed [Venerable XianChi speaking Vietnamese] anyone else I knew it anyone else hmm yes Diego let's hear some south american wisdom here well thank you master uh I don't think I'm just bragging It's just It's as if you know you came from oh yeah from south america somewhere bogota or yeah and you know calling in and you know yes sorry yeah I'm from bogota you got it right thank you master, I don't think she has to do anything because that would be like interfere with them I feel she just have to teach by example so when when they see that they are following the precepts and and like their life has changed so much they will naturally approach to her ummmm anyone else almost so it is almost so it is anyone else how do you say in Chinese 差不多如是，差不多如是 anyone else yes sir four along the lines Diego was saying just if if they improve themselves eventually the people will ask so when they ask that's when you can say something um anyone else what conch master he also had help from GuanYin and the protectors around him and the Dharma protectors did you dye your hair sorry what were you saying<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=1874">00:31:14</a> |  master he he also had um no about the hair no sir what kind of question is that right okay never mind what what's your answer again sorry the hair distracted me one day's flaming the others black I mean it's confusing<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=1907">00:31:47</a> |  he he had the emergency help from Guanyin and the the dharma the Dharma protectors don't you wish okay anyone else Q&A master uh I think she needs to wait till they have the need to learn Chan umm so proud of you it's not something southern California people can answer the wisdom seems to have migrated up north excellent very good hmm excellent see I trick you I said uh I said uh she saw the need their needs to do it but the key is do they see the need or not she she forgot about herself she saw the need that's why she did the Chan thing but unless people see the needs they have real needs like HuiKe here they won't do it there's no point in forcing the issue you have to wait until they see the need that's all okay and guess what they eventually will see the needs all you have to do is make yourself available you know until then you make yourself available my door is open you know my cubicle is open you know let's have a cup of tea next month you know whatever you know but just make yourself available that's all so that when they have the need they'll come and ask you point number one point number two like the south American wisdom okay uh you don't do anything Chan is that we don't scheme conch listen carefully we don't scheme we don't have to scheme we don't have to sell anything it's there and when they need it they'll ask okay so yes because they see people will see and when you all you have to do is continue to improve become better happier uh healthier what -ier can we do okay and then they see themselves and say oh I need to be like that you see that so that's a very subtle way the south American way to make it very subtle to to to create a need a little bit quicker by look at me all right very good so one day Bodhidharma called together the disciples<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=2105">00:35:05</a> |  and said it's time has come for me to return each of you say something to demonstrate your understanding so this is uh seems to start this silly thing that Chinese do you know after you go to ChanQi they have an exit interview and said give me your 心得 what is that you have in what insight did you have and that's what happened so I think Bodhidharma is the one who started it all to mess up all the chinese so now all the chinese do that now you go to a Chinese Qi and you is not a real Qi unless when you finish you go through exit interview and say what is that you what is your understanding and they have to say something okay and say 如是如是 everyone says 如是如是 so it is so it is and then they remain who they are okay so anyway say something to demonstrate your understanding this by the way is a trick question it's not meant for them to imitate venerable Bodhidharma said this to it's like a jab do you box it's a left jab see say something you got that a disciple named DaoFu said as I see it function of the way is the function<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=2211">00:36:51</a> |  of the way is not bound by word speech nor is it separate from words and speech very profound shall we continue is it more you have attained my skin we continue first before I comment okay can we do that is that okay I know you say say something master say something master I said no no that wait a little bit okay<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=2256">00:37:36</a> |  the nun ZongChi said according to my understanding it is like Ananda's glimpse of the realm of Akshobhya Buddha seen once it is never seen again Bodhidharma said you have attained my flesh<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=2280">00:38:00</a> |  a disciple named DaoYu four elements are all empty the five skandas are without actual existence I see that there is not a single dharma to be grasped and we should have the Chinese for this it annoys me when I don't see Chinese in these translations because I don't trust their translations at all okay these people the Chinese translators don't really understand Chan that's why I don't trust any of them okay in the future if you uh if you are you people are preparing you notice for example people have been working very hard preparing like Korean here Vietnamese here Chinese here okay so you know when you prepare can you make sure that I have the Chinese version here and they say oh my god master you're asking about the impossible where am I going to fit it I don't care not my problem I just want Chinese somewhere is it too much to ask stop complaining it hurts too much nine years and not reasonable okay so anyway and master Bodhidharma said you obtained my bones okay finally without<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=2374">00:39:34</a> |  saying HuiKe bowed and stood in his place Bodhidharma said you have attained my marrow precisely ah I forgot about this thing here okay 48 going back to these four characters<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=2389">00:39:49</a> |  yeah yeah you see he's going like this the boy is having a good time [Music] uh I'm glad to see some people are enjoying the lecture so DaoFu said as I see it the functional way is not bound by words and speech nor is it separate from words and speech old monk what do you have to say Very good! next! [Venerable XianChi begins to speak Vietnamese] I help you already, shut up if he's not bound by words and speech nor it's not separate from words and speech why does he have to open his mouth however this is correct therefore his understanding is superficial my skin skin deep this wisdom here is a wisdom of enlightened person but it is only skin deep<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=2488">00:41:28</a> |  next ZongChi, Chi, ZongChi hey by the way someone asked me can a woman be enlightened it's proof right here since Bodhidharma yes before we don't know maybe only Chinese women can be enlightened we don't know how about American women can they come and become enlightened well we'll find out so ZongChi said according to my understanding see I love to see the Chinese here would the Chinese start with according my understanding why do you even have to say that whatever she says doesn't it come from her understanding or is it is he stealing from from the old monk superfluous so clearly these first two here have a lot of free time to kill uh according to my understanding you know this is when you know us people who work in real have real-life jobs say you're wasting my time uh you're not getting that raise okay it is like Ananda's glimpse of the realm of Akshobhya Buddha seen once is never seen again uh so apparently there has a little bit deeper wisdom I don't know why okay anyone understands why it's deeper than skin hmm why good lord you don't get it anyone please don't embarrass me please say something meaningful the Chinese are watching it's all these guys been boasting saying we're better than us the Americans are better than us let's see how good they are say something smart anyone please Korea China I don't care the Korean look at them statues they all look down too it's a new style for statues you know you know they're all from Korea when they go like this Buddha statues are like this but no Korean is a so when they become enlighten these people in the future anyone else why is it deeper why is a high level wisdom please I beg you yeah I'm desperate yeah go ahead and say anything I don't care we might hit like you might get lucky I think I remember what master said the first time around no I never said anything about it about this I thought you said that something about it's just total nonsense so she knows that it's that there's nothing to be said because she just says nonsense boy was I wrong did you believe that ah god I'm glad we're redoing this because I'd be so embarrassed if I hear anyone talk like that oh good lord anyone else Catholic man he's saying say I'm here to learn Buddhism you know I don't want to watch these Buddhists make a fool of themselves speak nonsense what is this here's a difference this guy still remembers being bound by something yes this woman here Chinese woman does she remember anything nothing sticks in her mind this my guy here is still stuck on words and speech and no words in speech this woman here says I I saw the state of enlightenment I don't remember a darn thing nothing sticks that's true emptiness nothing whatsoever you like that same thing all the Koreans are you like it better XianJie you like it better very good he likes it better okay she's high level she says what am I supposed to understand I don't remember there's nothing here nothing worth remembering can you see that well anyway and someday you understand next has his flesh okay so skin flesh next<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=2908">00:48:28</a> |  DaoYu, education of the way okay which is a reminder we need to educate people okay your children in particular have to educate them about the way he said see he's better already according to my understanding he dropped it see that right there is improvement okay he says the four elements are all empty okay the five skandhas are without actual existence and I I can can someone give me the Chinese please I don't dare touch this unless I see the Chinese this is tricky reload q&a while they're reloading let's talk to that shoot the breeze okay remember before you say anything you have to uh maintain the standard the wisdom that I just elevated all of you to see they all yeah of course so American and the China and the Koreans would but look at the Americans of course yes go ahead this is just quoting the DaoYu's words 四大本空，五陰非有，而我見處，無一法可得 okay very good let me see 水火風本來是空的，眼耳鼻舌根也非實的，整個世界無一法可得 um um umm umm okay four elements are all empty he didn't mention five skandhas okay this is incorrect translation you see there's no word skandhas here the the version that Qun found, it says 四大本空，五陰非有，而我見處，無一法可得, I think the chinese here is more the 白話文. more the. ok very good. 五陰皆什麼？五陰非有 that's more Chan! who did this Chinese thing here has to be can we know this person here does this person have a name huh I'm not sure who did it maybe Jane okay I'm not sure okay uh uh it's not Jane someone was just adding it right now so we can't kill this person okay okay very good mm-hmm yeah please don't do the 白話 anymore okay give me the the actual the actual original text I'm not interested interested in the 白話 at all can you reload it again they changed it I'm sure the non-Chinese people are so bored and just give it to me anyway no you can't give it to you yeah you have to make sure that we learn from the Chinese wisdom first okay let's see what Chinese wisdom what's the level of Chinese wisdom they have here okay so uh oh this is 簡體 oh good lord this is mainland China person 四大本空，五陰非有，而我見處，無一法可得 okay of course I knew that this is a 見 character I'm not that dumb I just it's justified myself  you know so okay okay very good okay uh so here's what it means the four elements are all empty meaning there's uh there's nothing to make up this world okay this world here as we see is made up of the four elements okay you name anything it's solid it's made of you know the four elements our body is made of four elements this uh this uh beautiful uh uh uh halloween thing is made up of four elements okay four elements are wood uh water what else fire and wind okay okay so the four elements are empty so the wood is empty the water is empty the wind's empty everything is empty okay because they're empty therefore everything is that they they that that's made up of these four elements are empty so every are all empty so all is empty five skandhas without actual existance meaning there's no one there's no ego so outside there's no world inside there's no me so far so good 而我見處 but as I see it 無一法可得 can be obtain not 得 grasp here is obtained okay that's why this this this uh translation is off uh as I see you know as I see it there isn't a single dharma to be attained so far so good the four elements are fundamentally empty not all this is easy really this is simplified character again right oh these Chinese people have a way of of of uh throwing me off okay 五陰非有 the five skandhas don't exist that's the Chan terminology you want to simplify to make it punchy like when you want to punch someone you want to go as fast as quickly as possible you don't say okay you guys don't box at all clearly neither do I uh anyway so the five skandhas don't exist as I see it there is isn't a single dharma to be attained this is more interesting than the prior two prior two are amateurs okay this one is pretty good why what he's seeing he says that I know that the outside world is empty inside is also empty okay but but I know as I see it meaning I know okay 見 is that I know that there isn't a single dharma to be obtained okay so he has this profound emptiness understanding correction it was 五陰非有 not 五蘊, 五陰, 陰陽的陰 no no 陰 that 陰 is also skandhas the skandhas has two words 五蘊 or 五陰 okay they both are referred to skandhas depending on which translation version but they all refer to 陰 here is skandhas not the 姻緣的姻 okay this is a comment from Taiwan people don't trust them I can't trust the mainland China people I can't trust Taiwanese people what's happening in our world okay so far so good so what does it mean he says outside is empty inside is empty actually if you ask me of the entire universe there isn't a thing so he his vision is what and then the great master says you attain my bones so it's deeper so this is a deeper level wisdom why is it deeper deeper because<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=3615">01:00:15</a> |  the Koreans are going like this again okay I won't ask you don't worry relax relax Koreans anyone else oh Korean here number six I think what he mentioned is something similar from the Vajra sutra it's maybe it's a Vajra wiz wisdom they all have prajna wisdom oh okay prajna wisdom of wisdom you know it's all prajna wisdom but it's the prajna wisdom has different levels of depth okay so why is it deeper here six uh because uh this person here has a deeper understanding of emptiness XianJie are you checking my old notes check my old notes please say can you please check my own notes see what did I say I don't want to contradict myself go ahead q&a it's too embarrassing why would I contradict myself oh wow how stupid a comment that is it's self-defeating  [Venerable XianChi speaking Vietnamese] no keep going keep going translation and then he'll continue so master before we go into comparison or whatever first of all we need to understand the term of the words what does that mean so Buddha is mean like awareness anybody uh sentient being all have this type of awareness so if you pay attention you will see that in your mind like there will be one thought arise and then it will disappear and then the second thought arises and then it will disappear but like between the two thoughts there will be an empty space and that empty space is called um uh 如來 如來 thus come one so everybody all all have it and then but because we didn't aware of it and then we keep chasing after something else that's why it caused the affliction and then in the great compassion repentance in page 49 the verse is also that we and the Buddha all also have that but because it was covering up so that's why we didn't aware of it and uh so for the first two they still see like there's an emptiness there is a person that attends a person there's nothing to attend or whatever so it's similar to the blue sky then it still have a flashing light in the sky but then ultimately there's nothing for you to to see and then if you can maintain that emptiness it will be the same day and night that is the thus thus unmoving the thus come one and then uh if you pay attention to it all of us have it continue [Venerable XianChi speak Vietnamese] okay we're going to stop now so the the third person she also see it but then she still used the um the false thinking and then she still used the words to express it so basically she's still not uh truly entered that [Venerable XianChi and Master speak in Vietnamese] know your limitations you are in no position to comment about master XuanHua nor master XuYun translate that vietnamese part where I I yelled at him I scolded him so master like for example in the um the morning ceremony then and the three refugees and then there is a part that we say we vow that uh all living beings will understand the great way profoundly and bring forth the bodhi mind so uh this is similar to to that emptiness and then like um you know like when master XuanHua see that Master XuYun and the master XuYun say like uh you are like that and I'm like that go ahead q&a it's okay okay you have to know your limitations meaning that the reason I bring mentions one of the reasons why I mention certain people's levels and so forth is to tell you that if when they're higher than you do not touch them because you don't know their state don't make that mistake okay he said it's a state of wisdom that I don't understand it's a proper comment you don't say is that's what he means what how what do you know what he means you're no position to comment okay say so all right why is it higher I give you a very simple explanation okay this is a high level wisdom because see go back to go back to the first two first one says words and speech are meaningless so he says there is no words no no speech as the Chan school advocates  okay 言語道斷 the pathways of words and speech are terminated is terminated so he understands that good uh but he still use words and speech okay number two nun says I don't remember very good whatever I saw I don't remember whatever you taught me I don't remember excellent the third guy here is go beyond goes beyond that he says I see this emptiness here is huge there's nothing there okay it's like it's higher I use the word high high-level wisdom it's like you go into a high-rise building when you're low level you can see only your neighbor's house when you go to the tower you can see further you can see tennis courts you can see you can see the freeway you can see all those things you understand so the division is broader that's why it says the four elements meaning how this world is is composed is made of it's all empty that's how I see the entire my vision is of the entire world so my realm is bigger than the other two that's why it's higher he can see further than the other two they the other two can see emptiness but they cannot see as far as this guy that's why venerable Bodhidharma says you got my bones that's pretty good does it help the Chinese avoid explaining this okay because now you're touching you know these people who are you are you know who knows what level they are and you know and and uh venerable Bodhidharma you know what he did he teach them what dharma did he teach them we don't know so so whatever I told you take a grain of salt which is for fun only to make fun of the Chinese that's all and the Indians all right and finally HuiKe he bowed and stood<br/></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=4594">01:16:34</a> |  yes is it working yeah master when he said when he said um you have my bones and you have my marrow what does that mean like I am you I'm the same as you no no no it's not the same he says it refers to skin deep wisdom muscle deep wisdom bone deep wisdom and inside the bone that's it that's the deepest okay and that's amazing because because uh because by the time Bodhidharma left HuiKe attained a very very high level and what's amazing is that he didn't have a lot of disciples after that that's what's surprising to me at his level he should have a lot of eminent disciples okay but he didn't that's what is baffling to me now I look at this and says how come he didn't have a lot more eminent disciples like the sixth patriarch why not I mean you know he at that level he's an incredible teacher let me assure you I feel he's most incredible teacher and yet his disciples weren't there meaning that maybe the Chinese you know weren't available or something we don't know but to me it's amazing that venerable Bodhidharma transmitted his knowledge to HuiKe and and we're very very lucky that venerable HuiKe's level is extremely high and that's why uh that's why the knowledge uh to me that's that that's a kind of proof that the great dharma was transmitted to China back then it's for real okay and what I don't understand again is that how come at that level he didn't have that many more disciples so that Buddhism in China would prosper a lot quicker I don't understand that that's amazing number nine this is from Jane liar liar pants on fire<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=4746">01:19:06</a> |  in chinese is translated into 騙子騙子褲子著火 [Laughter] I like that translation the pants on fire yeah okay very good Korean translation how did we do in Korean translation hey Korean translator uh speak it out so that we can correct you say it loud we're double checking the Korean translator very good yeah this woman here is so hard to get any word out of her see still master do you hear me no I can't hear you I don't know how to translate it okay never mind okay so it's very good so this is this is so fantastic that that uh that um that when venerable HuiKe uh attained really attained the sudden teaching dharma from venerable Bodhidharma on 53 Bodhidharma recited the this poem originally I came to this land<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=4847">01:20:47</a> |  to rescue the deluded by transmitted dharma one flower will open in five petals with five petals and the fruit will ripen by itself 吾本來茲土，傳法救迷情，一花開五葉，結果自然成. so venerable Bodhidharma recited this poem not sure whether it's Chinese or or or in Sanskrit or whatever but he says I he got I think he got he got a little bit emotional he says original I came to this land looking back I came to this land, what for to rescue the deluded by transmitting the dharma to rescue all these deluded Chinese people okay and I transmit the dharma to my successor and in the future one flower will open with five petals okay so five beautiful uh manifestations uh five beautiful components of the great Chan dharma the five schools maybe and the fruit will ripen by itself okay and meaning what what does it mean the fruit by ripening itself Chinese people Indian people we don't have any Indian people do we no Indian people hmm we should be more open-minded and welcome more Indians uh what does it mean the fruit will be we or will be ripen by itself yes Diego seven uh maybe I think it's that the patriarch will get like in a higher level just by itself without the necessity of a master at that time yeah close enough yes six eventually the transmission of dharma will be successfully um given to the Chinese yeah okay basically he says my job is done you guys just uh I don't know where you're from but it's so clear to me I'm done here I'm out of here isn't that we Americans do I say I'm done hallelujah free at last free at last thank god I'm free at last huh because he's like remember he sat there for nine years is he gonna leave or what HuiKe refused to leave for nine years so finally I'm done the fruit will ripen by itself there's no need for for me to do anything anymore because it takes it will take care of itself okay I'm done I'm out of here but the Indians don't speak like we do all right<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5096">01:24:56</a> |  fifty-four three years after Bodhidharma's death ambassador SongYun of northern Wei is said to have seen him walking while holding a shoe at premier heights somewhere in India I guess okay so he saw Bodhidharma it could be real could be a vision we don't know SongYun asked Bodhidharma where he was going to which Bodhidharma replied I'm going home so apparently some kind of ambassador saw him between the borders the border region this area here between India and China so yes where are you going you went to China or India so he says I'm going home okay and 55 and why you're holding your shoes<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5145">01:25:45</a> |  Bodhidharma says you will know when you reach Shaolin monastery don't mention you saw me or you will meet with disaster and after arriving at palace soon told him emperor he met Bodhidharma on the way [Laughter] don't trust Chinese people<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5174">01:26:14</a> |  emperors said Bodhidharma is already dead and buried and SongYun arrested for lying [Laughter] serves him right [Laughter] sorry I told you I have no compassion whatsoever even for historical personalities yes sir number seven so I I imagine that in the future when the master is done he will be seen walking<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5201">01:26:41</a> |  in the Bahamas [Laughter] what a prediction praise the lord and at Shaolin monastery monks informed them that Bodhidharma was dead had been buried buried in a hill behind the temple okay<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5236">01:27:16</a> |  and the monks then said master has gone back home and prostrated three times for nine years he had remained and nobody knew him carrying a shoe in hand he went home quietly without ceremony okay probably some kind of verse here okay uh anyway it's Chinese monk so who cares what they say okay uh and this is Bodhidharma being depressed and said when is he gonna leave<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5265">01:27:45</a> |  me alone and you see how he did not even sit in full lotus he says I'm not teaching him nothing I hope he leaves soon but he refuses to leave and the the skull is interesting to me anyway uh 59 second patriarch okay HuiKe was born to family of Taoist scholars in what is now<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5297">01:28:17</a> |  Henan province china about 60 miles east of Luoyang and that's a capital and a bit north of the sacred mountain of SongShan a sacred mountain SongShan that's uh I don't know probably Shaolin temple when he was born his parents saw WeiTuo Bodhisattva golden armored spiritual protector come to offer protection not offer protection came and stand in guard I don't know who made this translation here it's not offer protection WeiTuo came and stood in guard okay there upon in 60 they named their son ShenGuang<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5350">01:29:10</a> |  which means spiritual light and that's from WeiTuo Bodhisattva's light not only was a patriarch intelligent but he has an excellent memory as well and his skills and power of discrimination was so remarkable that he could read 10 lines in the time it took an ordinary person to read one okay you have these strange traits manifestations okay of of remarkable individuals 61 in a gathering 100 people all talking at once he could clearly distinguish each conversation<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5387">01:29:47</a> |  that's impressive that's a very high processing power is that would you say it's like a tensor chip or m1 or m2x or whatever in today's power no oh you don't keep up with iphones and uh pixel ummm boring however had great anger he disagreed with everyone was always ready to fight asura okay as a young man HuiKe also studied Confucianism along with Taoism so this is a erudite he is well read very good because when you want to teach you need to have comparative things we teach worldly people you need to know where they're coming from and back then the worldly wisdom is being consists of Confucianism and Taoism there was the highest level of wisdom in china back then so he had to prepare himself now you're listening boys and girls you want to teach later you have to learn about worldly wisdom okay eventually not yet give yourself time I'm not dead yet the deaths of his parents cause HuiKe to turn to Buddhism why could not find the answer<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QitIlbgPvW4&list=PL0HTAkAoG7h_0T2Q3ZDghXeetqPkzovK7&t=5492">01:31:32</a> |  okay Buddhism has very profound insights into death that the other doctrines do not all right so at in 519 when he was 32 years old he became a Buddhist monk in a temple near Luoyang ancient capital about eight years later he left in search of Bodhidharma so he became a monk okay and he was well read well educated person and of course he read a lot of Buddhist scriptures okay and wasn't long before he was able to lecture on Buddhist scriptures see back then important point they did not have Chan at all that is why it was considered back then that Mahayana was not quite in China yet okay in other words Mahayana needs the backbone of Chan that's why Bodhidharma had to come to China in order to transmit specifically this dharma door called Chan okay so that's why even though you could lecture it's basically scholarly stuff all due respect to the scholars they put a lot of work blood and sweat into their acquisition of Buddhist knowledge but the knowledge is hair pore deep not even skin yet hasn't penetrated the world of wisdom yet so far so good and so uh 32 years he became a monk and eight years later so this guy is very very sharp he decided to follow great master Bodhidharma okay and he was about 40 years old okay so he started the age of 40. wow there's hope for you after all huh most of you are like in your 40s aren't you and the girl said yeah yeah that's me no you're not 40. don't laugh you must be around close to 60 I would say 60 uh he obeyed his teacher and went to hiding for 40 years oh wow so 40 to 49 okay and then he studied under Bodhidharma for some more years so let's say five six years okay so it's 54 55 and then went to hiding for 40 years so he's about 100 years oh wow that's too much no so clearly my master Bodhidharma didn't teach him much okay because when he was 80 he began to propagate the Buddha dharma okay meaning that he hid for 40 years he he uh he um he was around 40 when he became enlightened okay you know when he started so 40 49 years when are you how can the math doesn't add up i don't I don't get it this doesn't add up it's a chinese arithmetic for us it doesn't add up okay but anyway let's not worry about this you know this detail it's not that important okay whether it's 100 years or 200 years who cares okay and he started at 80 years old he began to propagate the Buddha dharma teaching and transforming living beings while 80 years old that's impressive 80 years let's see probably had to use a cane q&a Emituofo master in the history saying that the Bodhidharma went to China in the in the um fifth and between the fifth and the sixth century 502 to about 550 something but then the XuanZang dharma master who went to India to get Buddhism or to get Buddhist texts to translate in the early 600s meaning only 50 years after Bodhidharma so so meaning after Bodhidharma passed away the the Chan sect is not really uh popular yet no until like six patriarch in order yes it's not until the fourth and fifth patriarch that's when it used to have thousands of people cultivating oh I see okay yeah thank you back then there weren't a lot of people okay I weren't a lot of people who were willing to kneel for nine years okay all right uh later disciples of Bodhiruci another famous eminent monk back then and Vinaya master Kuang Tung tried to kill him he who and so he feigns insanity to uh to uh uh to fool them but he never ceases to save living beings who were ready to receive his teaching okay patriarchs uh when you hear these stories who would want to be a patriarch it's a lot of work a lot of grief and no reward okay 62 that's his parents oh why did I go back sorry uh 64. thank you about 534 northern Wei dynasty they had rural northern China collapsed under the weight of riots and revolts and northern China was split into two kingdoms new dynasties dynasties seized power and soon met with violent ends from to 557-581 much northern China not California was ruled by the northern Zhou dynasty all right 65 the northern Zhou emperor Wu who were persuaded that Buddhism has become too powerful and in 574 and 577 he attempted to abolish Buddhism in his kingdom and the patriarch HuiKe had to flee south he found a hiding place in mountains of southern AnHui province near the Yangtze river well it's yeah it's a lot of hardship now you know why there weren't a lot of followers because he's running for his life and hiding most of the time uh 66 according to the scholars today on a mountain name uh how why how come the two "s" Sukungshan there's a stone platform on which uh it is said that HuiKe lectured and the boulder it is said that marked a place where Huike pass bodhidharma's robe and bowl the successor SengCan SengCān cán or càn, càn càn càn càn càn  in time a very elderly HuiKe returned to north China he told his students he had to repay a karmic debt a day 199 593 a famous monk named him called him of heresy accused him of heresy not name him okay accuse him of a heresy the emperor ordered the district magistrate to arrest him and the patriarch was locked up and questioned are you human are you a freak asked the magistrate I'm a freak replied HuiKe magistrate knew the patriarch said this to avoid causing jealousy so he ordered him to tell the truth speak clearly what are you uh I am a freak replied HuiKe the Buddha dharma will not flourish until the time of forth patriarch he announced then he was executed he cut his head off instead of blood a white milky uh milky white liquid flowed into the chopping block must eat a lot of this white cheese thing the emperor knew they had executed a sage because you remember the 24th indian patriarch Aryasimha had also been beheaded and had not bled but white milky liquid had poured forth because he had been without outflows when no one has ignorance one may attain may attend to a state without outflows they enter the white Yang realm so the blood becomes white wow that's too much so can you imagine go to Kaiser hospital and try to give blood uh you go ahead seven master is your blood red or white my blood is red hot because of the anger issues 71 realizing he was a bodhisattva in the flesh emperor felt great shame a bodhisattva had came to our country he said and instead of offering him protection we killed him excuse me and the emperor had all the great officials take refuge with this strange Bhikshu political thing you know a real politician you know this is great sage let's all take refuge with him even though he's dead and the name they gave themselves their own dharma names letter to student by Dr. Suzuki translation you have truly comprehended the dharma as it is the deepest truth lies oh my god I want I need chinese I need chinese oh yeah yeah these people are not qualified to translate uh Chan texts but that's see what else see if you can find it please anyway I can't understand when it's more than one sentence I struggle it is due to one's ignorance that the mani-jewel is taken from piece of brick for a piece of brick but when one is suddenly awakened to self-enlightenment is realize that one is in possession or real jewel oh yeah yeah yeah what a boring stuff I'd rather have some cold noodles than reading this the ignorant and the enlighted are of one essence they are not really to be separated who asks you to be separate oh god lord I mean it says they contradict themselves they want essence they are not really to be separated who asks you we should know that all things are such as they are who cares tell me how to get rich those no no no actually it doesn't sound right tell me how to get a bigger temple those who entertain a dualistic view of the world are to be pitied that I write this letter for them who's this HuiKe okay he came from saying nothing to being very verbose what happened old age he lost his marbles I write this letter for them when I know that between this body and the Buddha there is nothing to separate one from the other what is the use of seeking after nirvana something is turning ourselves it's too verbose like the old monk here our old monk okay any questions about venerable Huike he's an extraordinary individual I'm I'm so I'm I'm so happy that we discovered that is his uh it's uh he's uh he he got a lot from venerable Bodhidharma's teaching and so that's why Chinese Buddhism was in good hands when Bodhidharma left now you understand why Bodhidharma left because he knew that he's no longer needed you understand they don't waste time they stick around only because they are needed they're not needed they go home all right questions comments we are learning about this to appreciate the depth of Chinese Buddhism it started with the second Chinese patriarch HuiKe okay very very impressive Chinese monk okay uh what happened oh in simplified again oh my god you guys are just want the end of me the student is not very bright is he that's why it's so verbose okay not interest not interested in this letter at all sorry yeah next a few more minutes any questions uh all right let's see what kind of patriarch venerable SengCàn cān or cán cān.  SengCàn SengCàn okay  look at him love the nose what do you call the kind of nose you physionomist Chinese physiologist is that a good nose or a bad nose nevermind 77 little known about him transmission of the lamp the records there produced in a song dynasty by uh 釋道原 author of famous Chan poem 信心銘 okay inscription on the mind of faith okay so not much okay but he produces Chan poem called 信心銘 okay and uh and uh inscription on the mind of faith uh that's he composed that when he first came to visit the second second patriarch his body is recovered with repulsive sore like those are a leper oh yuk where are you from asked the second patriarch what are you doing here I have come to take refuge to the high master and study and cultivate the Buddha Dharma answers SengCan you have loathsome disease and your body is filthy how can you study the Buddha Dharma 79 SengCan said I'm a sick man you are a high master he said but in our true minds where is the difference there upon the second patriarch transmitted a dharma to him saying this rope and bowl have been passed on from Bodhidharma they certify that you have received the dharma seal that's all the training no nine years [Laughter] what's going on this simplified too much I'm worried now about the third generation is it for real really that's it so easy that way I want to become a patriarch too in order to protect it you must go into hiding because Bodhiruchi's followers will try to harm you be very careful and let no one know that you have received transmission SengCan asked HuiKe saying I'm diseased I implore you to cleanse me of my offenses what did he do 81 HuiKe says said bring me your offense I will cleanse it for you i cleanse you of it oh yeah yeah cleanse you of it it's gotta be Chinglish SengCan thought for a while and said I cannot get at it 覓罪不可得 close enough, that's okay HuiKe replied then I have cleansed uh you of it should live by the Buddha dharma and sangha okay well that's a nice way of cleansing the all the illnesses let's try that sometimes 83 I can see you as a monk a member of the Buddhist community what are the Buddha and the teaching all of a sudden now there is Chinese I'm confused 84. this mind is Buddha this mind is a teaching the teaching and Buddha are not separate this is also true of the sangha not the community oh good lord change it to sangha okay 是心是佛， 是心是法 法佛無二，僧寶亦然 huh the Dharma is not teaching the mind is the Dharma the Dharma Dharma and Buddha are not two don't say separate two and the sangha jewel so is a sangha jewel okay anyway it doesn't matter it's not a Chan thing so who cares okay it doesn't do much for the people who read it okay it's not meant as instruction for you to become enlightened so who cares okay why waste time on this okay did you fix it okay there you go very fast very good 85. today for the first time I have realized that the essence of offense is not inside not outside not in between so it is also a mind the Buddha and teaching are not separate either who is he teaching against sorry I forgot how can HuiKe reply oh yeah HuiKe to SengCan so SengCan said so I cleanse it for you okay fine and then I see you monk okay uh what are the Buddha and the sangha okay and uh this mind Buddha is mind is Dharma and the Dharma Buddha are not two so is a sangha jewel very good for the first time you realize essence of offense are and the Dharma are uh um 佛法無也 there's no Buddha there's no Dharma what is it Buddha and the teaching as separate either oh good lord the Chinese says Buddha Dharma no osi I mean two oc french excuse me I heard that Abba broke up again I know it broke my heart I was looking forward to their new album they have you know I'm an Abba fan dancing queen [Music] clark can I enjoy music thank you yeah I said yeah yeah because Clark is giggling at me oh god he looks so ridiculous okay so and HuiKe saw profound understanding shaved his head SengCan cultivated under the second patriarch his illness gradually improved that's what happens when you're sick you became a monk and you know good things happen okay and that's natural by the way if it doesn't happen you don't improve uh change temples HuiKe gave robe and bowl two years later wow only two years what's with these people I think it's fake it's too easy no seriously they make us look bad the Chinese beat us again [Laughter] he gave SengCan instruction not to teach publicly because of impending danger uh predicted by 27th patriarch uh Prajnatara uh third patriarch feigned insanity while he taught living beings okay they all have to pretend to be crazy okay uh not to draw attention to themselves 87 during persecution Buddhism by emperor Wu northern Zhou dynasty the patriarch fled into mountains while hid there tigers wolves leopards fierce animals all disappeared he ate them all wondered mountains for 10 years with no fixed abode Hinayana practice okay 88 he met 道信 that's the fourth patriarch a novice monk of just 14 in 592 592. 道信 attended 僧璨 (SengCan) uh attended to SengCan for nine years received dharma transmission when he was still in his early 20s oh my god the Chinese beat us again after transmitting dharma to the fourth patriarch 道信 master SengCan invited 1 000 Bhikshu to great vegetarian feast who is no longer crazy or something after they have eaten he said you think that to sit in full lotus is the best way to die watch I demonstrate my mastery over birth and death showing off before he die he left a dining hall followed by the thousand Bhikshu can you imagine these Chinese are something else he halted by the trunk of a tree and after pausing for a moment for you know like before you enter the stage you take a pause hello there uh he lept up and grabbed a big branch and while swinging from tree from the tree by one hand he entered nirvana I mean he croaked okay and enter nirvana is the Chinese or something else he just died oh he's not he didn't enter nirvana how do they know seriously how would you know he entered nirvana or not oh and the Chinese are encourageable ninety uh first Chan poem in China was composed by him the 信心銘 okay first Chan poem ever in China interesting song of enlightenment and so on later was uh composed by the seventh patriarch 永嘉 which we will you know explain in our Chan class because otherwise I'm running out of time to discuss these scriptures is it okay Korean during a Chan class dharma talk we can spend a little bit of time talking about the song of enlightenment because the Chinese said oh this is a Chinese you know Chinese masterpiece that we will take it to pieces okay we shred it dissect it okay open it up okay uh and with something called um 參同契 there's no English translation that's why it's no English title was composed by 石頭 another uh peer of master 馬祖 and then another one poem composed called 寶鏡三昧歌 the jewel mirror samadhi song okay and then there's more okay this is the extent of my Chinese okay next<br/></p>
