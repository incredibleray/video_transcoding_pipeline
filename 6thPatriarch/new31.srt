for

22
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:41,470
hello everyone today is the 13th of august
2022. we are gathered here to continue discussing

23
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:53,180
the sixth patriarch sutra we on slide 191 chapter
2. it talks about Russia this Buddhist wisdom

24
00:07:53,180 --> 00:08:02,810
that we all are endowed with and were are
learning how to unveil it and wield it for

25
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:09,520
ourselves suit the text if you give rise a
genuine practicing contemplation illumination

26
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,160
in a kasana all false thoughts are extinguished
if you recognize yourself nature in a single

27
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,400
moment of enlightenment you will arrive at
the stage of a Buddha

28
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:32,240
guantanadine

29
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:42,339
okay uh not sure why we have a highlighted
bora guan chao okay but translation is is

30
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:55,000
okay um the debate track says if you give
rise to genuine press and contemplation illumination

31
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,120
in a kasana all false thoughts are extinguished
okay what is he talking about he's talking

32
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:12,490
about the fact that if you're able to use
your prajna wisdom okay what for the prajna

33
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:22,350
wisdom is for two purposes to contemplate
and to illuminate

34
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:28,150
what does it mean using your prajna wisdom
whatever Buddha wisdom you have you already

35
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:34,529
have okay now you don't know what it is you
don't know where it is but you have it already

36
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:43,640
okay you're we all like having this priceless
pearl our parents sewn up in our clothing our

37
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:49,560
parents gave us and we are not aware of what
it is we don't know where it is we just know

38
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:57,170
there is some something precious priceless
okay that we are so wealthy we're so rich

39
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:03,990
and yet worldly people they seek outside instead
of looking at themselves look at their own

40
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:11,910
treasure they go outside looking for treasure
from the outside in terms of treasure island

41
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:22,360
in terms of fort knox okay in terms of gold
ingots in terms of mining the precious metals

42
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:33,380
especially nowadays you know when you have
rare earth metals you are very very wealthy

43
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:44,310
and so you know what rare earth metals are
for to make EV batteries without those ingredients

44
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:52,350
those raw materials you can not make EV uh
EV batteries for example an ounce of gold

45
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:59,700
is two thousand dollars an ounce of rare earth
element I forgot the element name is worth

46
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,649
how much

47
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:12,660
Billy how much is rare with this one this
one rare earth element give me a number

48
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:19,200
use your imagination

49
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:27,200
give a hint hey hey tick-tock girl give a
hint to your dad don't give it to me

50
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,330
what did she say

51
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:38,610
see he defers to his precious daughter how
much

52
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,240
10 ten dollars

53
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:51,330
is it ten dollars ten what

54
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:59,120
ten what huh let's see how good is her arithmetic
how far can she count

55
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,460
10 what

56
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:12,060
oh no she just says 10 because she only had
10 figures

57
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:25,350
oh I asked her is it 10 she said yeah yeah
okay close enough it's more than ten thousand

58
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,640
it's fifteen thousand dollars a pound

59
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:42,160
i mean an ounce I'm sorry an ounce is fifteen
thousand gold an ounce of gold is 2 000.

60
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,839
because what they call a rare earth elements
anyway we're not talking about money here

61
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:55,730
talking about something a lot more precious
than money so see you have this prajna wisdom

62
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:03,930
which is priceless okay and no money uh in
this world is enough to pay for it okay and

63
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:11,320
yet you own it okay so it's called your genuine
prajna wisdom and what you just do this

64
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:19,290
who uses wisdom for to contemplate and illuminate
okay so the translation is correct it's a

65
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:28,210
good translation okay you use your genuine
wisdom inherent wisdom you already have your

66
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:34,160
prajna wisdom your Buddha wisdom you will
okay to contemplate and illuminate that's

67
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,050
the nature of prajna wisdom to contemplate
to illuminate

68
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:52,019
okay why contemplate why illuminate?

69
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:59,740
this is how you use the prajna wisdom you
have to contemplate okay so it means to contemplate

70
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:09,740
is that you focus single-mindedly on something
is to contemplate is it clear so for example

71
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,899
you think of let's say what happened to all
the boys they're all helping carry some display

72
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:21,000
cases and now they all disappear

73
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,160
we lost some only A-Hung and Francis came
back because they had to work well I thought

74
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,101
of taking the afternoon off I was pooped i
only used one arm if someone forced me and

75
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:41,029
said master you're the master you can only
use one finger and say okay I ended up using

76
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:49,340
one arm I'm really exhausted imagine I use
two arms I'm pretty probably have to lecture

77
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,339
lying down

78
00:14:53,339 --> 00:15:02,079
anyway so we lost all the strong men only
the weak men are here

79
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:10,370
okay so your prajna wisdom your wisdom
uh in order to use your prajna wisdom what

80
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:18,360
you do you need to contemplate contemplate
means that let me see you see what I mean

81
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:26,389
that's contemplation right there let me look
that's what you do you naturally contemplate

82
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:30,880
when you must notice that

83
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:40,339
okay and let's say you remember me and say
let me see

84
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:46,120
familiar okay so that's contemplation right
there let me see I mean let me focus

85
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:54,890
that is contemplate at the exclusion of everything
else is that clear so you to contemplate is

86
00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:03,430
to look at something single-mindedly at exclusion
of everything else that's what definition

87
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:10,310
of contemplation I don't care wherever you
go whether it's Hinayana non-Buddhist it's

88
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:17,389
the same thing contemplate is to do that that's
why when we teach you time we teach you to

89
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:24,889
hone and increase your contemplation skills

90
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:32,550
is that clear and when you contemplate okay
then you also illuminate that's practical

91
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:42,990
wisdom prajna wisdom is to be able to focus
single-mindedly this is why Mahayana we teach

92
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:51,230
you Chan and we stress the concept of being
single-minded we don't stress mindfulness

93
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:58,430
and all those things that other people teach
because that will not bring your prajna wisdom

94
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:04,860
will not activate your prajna wisdom is
that clear in order for your prajna wisdom

95
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:12,360
to be activated you need to be signal-minded
not mindful

96
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:21,720
is it clear you can be totally unmindful but
as soon you need to you single-mindedly look

97
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:33,840
at something that's your prajna wisdom in
action no mindfulness crap

98
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,370
no smiling no hugging trees

99
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:49,200
is that clear what all those things do the
smiling hugging trees is for fun for the Kodak

100
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,429
moment

101
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:55,820
something odd okay

102
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:10,080
oh weird okay so the contemplate to contemplate
is being single-minded is that clear? single-minded

103
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,620
and when you are single-mindedly use it and
you have your prajna wisdom your prajna

104
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:24,419
wisdom will naturally shine light upon what
you're contemplating okay that's why when

105
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:30,860
you have prajna wisdom is always two things
you contemplate and illuminate as a result

106
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,210
of your contemplating

107
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:47,070
is it clear now the question is why didn't
the great teacher say if you contemplate

108
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:54,539
and forget about illumination or how about
just use if you use genuine prajna to illuminate

109
00:18:54,539 --> 00:19:03,169
and forget about contemplation why has to
be Guan Zhao not just Guan or Zhao she might

110
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:08,380
understand the nature of my question the question
here is you have contemplation and illumination

111
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,410
why not just either one of the two

112
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:20,140
why not yes nine from Diego when you contemplate
you see the dark spots when you illuminate

113
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:25,559
you dissolve that darkness

114
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,460
okay

115
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:35,160
so so what he's saying is that you
contemplate alone you still have some blind

116
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:41,210
spots some spots you things you cannot see
that's why you need to illuminate what about

117
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:50,030
if you illuminate alone you shine a bright
light on everything why did you contemplate

118
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:58,210
the only answer half give half of the answer
what about the other half of the question

119
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,450
can't you simply illuminate and forget about
contemplation

120
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:11,299
hello everyone anybody out there

121
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:26,289
oh it's just another break in the wall
never mind you guys are so unmusical yes six

122
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:54,929
hello sorry about that um geez what was what
was it about oh um contemplation sorry uh

123
00:20:54,929 --> 00:21:00,590
you have to contemplate because then you're
you're focusing on the item not just illuminating

124
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:10,549
and why can't simply illuminate and forget
about contemplation

125
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:19,320
you are not answering the question I don't know
you don't know is the answer okay

126
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:28,650
nine from Alta-D contemplation makes the illumination
specific

127
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:36,440
okay he's touching somewhere close enough
from Diego both go together contemplation

128
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,820
will show you a single-minded view of what's
contemplated illumination will give you a

129
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:49,289
deeper view of the object then both grow exponentially
together it's hard to explain with words master

130
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:53,650
when you don't get it you cannot explain what
words you don't you you don't still don't

131
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,650
understand

132
00:21:54,650 --> 00:22:05,909
okay you need to contemplate illuminate number
one your contemplate and without illumination

133
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:12,870
then you still have some dark areas you cannot
see clearly so you need to illuminate so what

134
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:18,650
happens is when you contemplate your prajna
wisdom also illuminates naturally okay so

135
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:25,370
far so good however what if you only illuminate
forget about the contemplation illuminating

136
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:33,270
is like you turn on bright lights everywhere
but you really lack focus you really don't

137
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:38,919
understand the details of the depth you lack
the details and the depth of concentration

138
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:46,150
or contemplation okay just like tell me what
you see and you you write a whole essay instead

139
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:56,049
of all they want you to focus on is one single
point you him that's it okay so you need contemplation

140
00:22:56,049 --> 00:23:04,990
to provide focus to provide a focal point
okay otherwise you become scattered illuminate

141
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:16,190
alone is not enough so far so good next 93
uh commentary if you recognize yourself nature

142
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:24,940
then okay sorry we're not done yet in a kasana
all false thoughts are extinguished okay this

143
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:31,820
is the secret people keep on asking me when
they learn they came and learn uh came to

144
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:38,210
our Chan classes or they came to our pureland
training session they said master I recite

145
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,970
the Buddha's name but I still have a lot of
thoughts they come in between or people would

146
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:50,669
say master I've been meditating for a year
now and for for two months now I still I'm

147
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:56,580
discovering that my head is full of thoughts
i keep on thinking and thinking and thinking

148
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:04,830
i ask only during or during meditation he
says come and think of it I'm like that all

149
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:16,330
day long not just during meditation I said
bingo okay so that's what happens your

150
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:25,250
our heads are full of false thoughts okay
false thoughts refers to the the thinking or

151
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:33,809
the thoughts that arise naturally in spite
of ourselves the will arise

152
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:40,659
okay and just like what are them are they
it's take look at it this way when we talk

153
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:45,100
about false thoughts it's like you're sitting
here and all of a sudden your neighbors turns

154
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:52,150
on the music okay you have no control over
it that's the nature of false thoughts they

155
00:24:52,150 --> 00:25:00,330
hit they get into your head and you cannot
help yourself

156
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:08,029
okay now so therefore the two kinds of false
thoughts one that not that's involuntary meaning

157
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:15,270
is not your fault and number two is voluntary

158
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:20,890
is that clear the two kinds of false thoughts
the Chan people don't teach you that I'm I'm

159
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:30,240
dissecting it for you the false thoughts there
are one is uh involuntary okay the other is

160
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:37,950
voluntary meaning involuntary meaning that you
did not generate the false thoughts okay not

161
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:48,130
intentionally okay and voluntary is intentional
you think about it you involuntary meaning

162
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,650
you didn't think about it they just pop into
your heads

163
00:25:50,650 --> 00:26:04,419
and voluntarily is that you actually consciously
are thinking about that generating those thoughts

164
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:07,570
that's the nature of your false thinking and
your false thoughts

165
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:29,350
okay there's a question in the back too


167
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:43,549
master, I 
have a question when when you talk about false

168
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:51,400
thought is that that the mind um Pan Yuan
um climbing on conditions climbing on the

169
00:26:51,400 --> 00:27:01,870
condition or the mind itself generated the
false thought

170
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:10,850
that's why I just talked about voluntary and
involuntary I don't need to use big words

171
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:21,330
anyone else anyone else has an idea or some
comments or suggestions okay okay now the

172
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:28,500
two false thoughts are involuntary or voluntary
involuntary is that you had nothing to do

173
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:35,490
with it it just came in to your head somehow
shows up in your head like that music right

174
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:42,789
there in your neighbor or the car noise right
there the drive-by and the noise is perceived

175
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:48,830
by you you didn't do anything it just came
to you it's called involuntary so the thoughts

176
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:59,399
come to you in a involuntarily that without
you doing anything so far so good okay

177
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:08,290
so for example you sit there all sun a thought
arises it says Gelato!

178
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:16,320
ever happened today

179
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,659
i don't know about gelato but one thought
that comes to mind yesterday afternoon

180
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:24,130
watermelon

181
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:36,820
no well it's so hot you know when it so hot
so when I was younger I was so hot I said

182
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:42,620
the ocean

183
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:51,970
okay because I used to live by the ocean okay
so those come naturally okay you don't even

184
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:59,950
you don't even think they just came okay and
that's called even involuntary and then after

185
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:09,780
the involuntary thought then you
say oh yeah gelato bulgarinis not just any

186
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:16,809
gelato because many gelato we find shops out
there in southern california are fakes they

187
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:26,100
they call themselves gelato but actually it's
not really true gelato gelato gelato if i

188
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:33,770
may give you a very short lesson on gelatos
okay it's condensed ice cream it's uh flavor

189
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:38,210
is more intense than ice cream it's a hell
a lot more expensive oh excuse me boys and

190
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:46,070
girls and it's a lot more expensive than ice
cream you can tell right away okay ice cream

191
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:56,690
scoop is like four or five dollars gelato
is twice as much

192
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:04,610
anyone thinking of gelato [Laughter] see what
i mean okay so they come to you naturally

193
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:11,490
okay uh okay not of your doing okay that's
called involuntary but for me it's voluntary

194
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:18,360
because I'm thinking of it you see that that's
what happens the thought comes you it arises

195
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,950
naturally and you follow the thought that's
called voluntary thinking you chase after

196
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:34,669
it so Chan meditation is you look at the
involvement involuntary thoughts and not chase

197
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:41,529
after them that's all

198
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:48,720
what happens to ordinary people is that they
cannot discern the difference between involuntary

199
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:55,809
thoughts and voluntary thoughts so to them
they're all the same

200
00:30:55,809 --> 00:31:04,769
okay in particular especially for those some
of you present today who are depressed severely

201
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:14,950
depressed you wake up in the morning within one
minute you have a thought that arises immediately

202
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:20,899
it says I don't feel good

203
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:26,659
I'm speak from speaking from experience boys
and girls I'm this is not imagination this

204
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:36,450
is not from a movie this is my own life huh
i don't feel good

205
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:42,799
what happened to a Texas guy he disappeared
to Texas is he still alive or dead anyway

206
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:54,480
go ahead nine no okay so the thought that
i don't feel good okay

207
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:17,929
that's involuntary you know why this depression
ghost he says don't feel good

208
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:23,120
nine is boredom the depression ghost

209
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:35,240
wait wait, is that my alarm

210
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
someone goes with her

211
00:32:36,240 --> 00:33:24,110
videotape go videotape

212
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:33,480
that's not my alarm it's not um should I um
yeah I asked the question okay um I also have

213
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,650
a second question

214
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:44,130
oh wait here's the first one I have a question
about contemplation and illumination we have

215
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:51,429
to exercise our will to choose what we contemplate
but the illumination is done by our Buddha

216
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:58,539
nature is this correct repeat the question
please

217
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:05,940
we have to exercise our will to choose what
we contemplate but the illumination is done

218
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:13,720
by our Buddha nature is this correct that's
correct who asked Alta-D okay very good

219
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,879
that's how it works you have to say I want
to look at this

220
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:28,579
oh that's my alarm it was yours okay and then
and then naturally your prajna light will

221
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:31,560
illuminate it

222
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:42,159
okay yes okay Alta-D also has a second question
master this week I was reading Master XuanHua's

223
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:48,849
commentary on the vajra sutra he said that
we should constantly all day turn the light

224
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:57,510
and illuminate within even during other daily
activities is there a way to illuminate without

225
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:07,000
like illuminate while we work or walk around
or talk to people

226
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:16,040
you've well it's a process where when you
return the light to illuminate within refers to

227
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:25,580
a process you need to practice to be you know
in order to open your wisdom once you open

228
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:31,480
your wisdom then you can illuminate outside

229
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,680
okay so what happened to ordinary people is
they never learn to illuminate inside that's

230
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:44,440
why when they illuminate outside they cannot
see clearly because they are confused in order

231
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,730
for you to see clearly you need to remove
confusion in yourself first inside yourself

232
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:57,770
first before you can see clearly outside of
yourself so ordinary people their emphasis

233
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:06,260
is different they they are messed up they
mess up the order the order of things is that

234
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:13,099
you make sure you are clear-headed before
you look outside that's why we are you are

235
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:23,520
taught to illuminate inside return the light
and illuminate inside

236
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:31,880
yes this question is from Heidi master

237
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:39,440
which false thought which false thought is
easy to get rid of first thank you master

238
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:52,240
there's no easy thought that needs to get
rid of okay they all need to be removed whatever

239
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,920
the way that I will teach you is whatever
kinds of false thoughts that keep on arising

240
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:07,800
frequently okay those are the one you need
to focus on to remove otherwise they're the

241
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:17,380
errant thoughts that don't come back uh it's
just not something you need to worry about

242
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,210
okay good questions anything else

243
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:43,720
[question in Vietnamese]

244
00:37:43,720 --> 00:38:14,720
Amituofo master, I have a question is this the
false thought arise is because of our discrimination

245
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:24,410
or it is on itself nature it is that way and
why is it that our prajna wisdom

246
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:35,650
why is it

247
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:43,089
go ahead why is it that our prajna
wisdom if we we are confused and false thinking

248
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:51,390
how is that cover up this prajna wisdom

249
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:59,970
okay and the question is not worth answering
because the more I answer such questions the

250
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:09,359
more you have questions okay that will lead
to nowhere it's not about recognizing the

251
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:18,619
the false thought how it came about is about
knowing what to do with it knowing recognizing

252
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:30,079
where it comes from doesn't matter is irrelevant

253
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:36,670
and that's what people spend their entire
lives doing chasing after knowledge why why

254
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:44,030
why? but they never learn how to get rid
of the false thoughts how to deal with the

255
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:51,130
false start they only want to know why they
arise it's like the same way asking why am

256
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:58,761
i hungry why am I depressed I can give you
one reason and then you ask another and you

257
00:39:58,761 --> 00:40:07,339
ask another and ask another there's no end
to it that's why I don't answer such questions

258
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:13,590
that's why if you ask me such questions i
i can't answer you he asked me how do I put

259
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:19,470
an end to this particular thought that I can
teach you if that's not what you're looking

260
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:27,609
for you come to the wrong place I have no
interest in telling you and discussing you

261
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:33,250
the events of the world what's going on in your
head and why it's not enough time for that

262
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:39,890
there's no end to it you're so confused and
you want to know why am I confused instead

263
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:48,290
of learning how do I put an end to my confusion
because if you confuse I tell you why you

264
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:54,420
confuse it does not end your confusion

265
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:59,609
i can only I'm willing to tell you how to
put an end to your confusion what you need

266
00:40:59,609 --> 00:41:10,260
to do put in your confusion I'm not willing
to discuss you why you're confused

267
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:18,200
because if I discuss it with you you ask more
questions which is has happened already because

268
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:25,610
my telling you why would not end your confusion
will only create more confusion for you that's

269
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:31,099
the truth this is why I don't indulge in explaining
to you why

270
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:43,260
it has never worked in the history of buddhism
the last 3000 years

271
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:50,900
what we focus on teaching you is what you
need to do to how

272
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:59,140
you go about putting an end to your confusion
putting an end to your false thoughts not

273
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,700
why you have false thoughts

274
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:42,450
[speak in Vietnamese]

277
00:42:42,450 --> 00:43:05,400
master, our people people like me how can they know
about stopping the ego stop being the false

278
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:11,319
thought if I don't know about the fundamental
on where it comes from the source of it master

279
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:19,690
only taught us how to stop the thought but
it's only temporary I just want to completely

280
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:26,140
cut off all of the false thought false thought
from the source itself that's why I asked

281
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:31,230
the question where's the source of the false
thought came from

282
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:50,339
tim one talked to her where is she confused
hmm she's totally confused why

283
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:58,640
this is her particular problem she's always
had which you don't have

284
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:06,480
that's why I doubt that any of you will be
able to point out what her problem is

285
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,410
but give it a try what's her problem

286
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:38,390
go ahead Q&A, let me see your level of wisdom
here

287
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:44,680
very good she wants to do it her way

288
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:51,150
it's like a sick patient says I want to get
well but doctor you have to treat me my way

289
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:59,700
i have to agree to your treatment otherwise
I'm not willing to do it

290
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:07,490
you ask a surgeon you are sick you need to
be operated upon you ask the best surgeon

291
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:12,770
there is in the world would you come to him
and say I want you to operate on me but will you

292
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:16,740
do it my way please

293
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,210
you have to tell me exactly what you're gonna
do and I have to agree to everything you do

294
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,369
to me before I let you operate on me

295
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:31,099
you're an idiot how can you tell a surgeon
what to do what are you doing wasting time

296
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:37,339
the surgeon's time and tell him what to do
you want your life to be saved then you should

297
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:43,580
put your trust in him that you have faith
he can do a good job and save your skin you

298
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:51,800
don't believe him don't have to come to him
you're confused and you insist on doing things

299
00:45:51,800 --> 00:46:00,450
your way because I can figure it out exactly
Q&A this is a problem with stupid people the

300
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:07,750
thing that can figure it out the reason you
call stupid is not me the Buddha calls you

301
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:14,099
stupid I simply repeat the words I'm not I'm
not I'm not adding any more spices on top

302
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:22,740
of it Buddhas call us stupid because we don't
know

303
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:35,280
what we want we don't know what to do and
we insist on having it our way

304
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,119
that's why it's called stupidity because you
insist on your stupid ways there's no way to

305
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,849
explain to you

306
00:46:44,849 --> 00:46:51,030
and that's why you remain stupid lifetime
after lifetime of the lifetime because you're

307
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:58,480
so full of your stupid self

308
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:52,530
it's the ego who says do it my way do it my
way otherwise I won't believe 

309
00:47:52,530 --> 00:48:14,809
you [Speak in Vietnamese]

310
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:23,650
i apologize I think you mistaken my intention
i don't need the answer in that way I just

311
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:32,670
wanted to understand is that I've heard from
the perfect enlightenment sutra that a human

312
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:40,160
we have three doubts and I just regurgitate
the verse and I just wanna understand the

313
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:46,829
original source of my confusion the false
thought where that where do they come from

314
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:50,000
but if I offended you I apologize sincerely

315
00:48:50,000 --> 00:49:01,040
she doesn't get it, does she? I tried to tell
her that if I explain to you why it will not

316
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,680
end your doubts and your questioning you keep
on asking why if you explain that to me why

317
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,020
do you say that and I explained I said that
because of this and he said why do you say

318
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:17,660
that you keep on asking and asking and asking
there's no end to it because your stupid mind

319
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:27,329
is Changing looking for an answer it's not
the way to solve your stupidity

320
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:33,460
that's why that's why I don't answer I don't
answer because it will not put an end to your

321
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:40,550
suffering an end to your questioning because
you want to know more and more here's what

322
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:47,780
happens let me paint it for you in a simple
way for you the problem you have is here i

323
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:53,069
can explain to you why the cause for that
and then you understand the cause and then

324
00:49:53,069 --> 00:49:58,180
next you say why was this the cause of it
i explained to you again I'll give you another

325
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:03,280
reason and then you say okay I understand
i agree with you can you tell me why this

326
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:11,900
is a reason and on and on and on and on there's
no end to it that's why we don't engage in

327
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:20,309
doing those things that will not put an end
to your

328
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:24,960
lack of clarity

329
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:32,270
i think I make myself pretty clear but she
doesn't seem to get it okay I'm afraid I cannot

330
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:39,550
help answer your questions nothing personal
go ahead eight from Lio how can we get rid

331
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:44,140
of false thoughts is there a difference between
the way of eliminating false thoughts when

332
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:49,619
it's involuntary or voluntary when I meditate
i try to recite the Buddhist name constantly

333
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:54,740
but most of the time I'm interrupted by false
thoughts clearly I have intention to focus

334
00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:02,260
on reciting but out of nowhere involuntarily
I'm on the false thought yes it's just a simple

335
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:10,150
fact there's a false thought you will arise
okay when I discern voluntary versus involuntary

336
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:19,090
involuntary is for the advanced levels okay
at your level Lio, you don't need to

337
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:26,300
worry about involuntary voluntary when I explain
involuntary is in order to tell you right

338
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:32,089
now there's a reason for that is in order
to tell you that it doesn't matter you understand

339
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:38,030
or not okay if you understand I give you an
example of depression the depression ghost

340
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:48,290
it says few bad they plant the thought in your
head okay and you most for most people they

341
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:54,770
think it's their thoughts like people like
Daniel who says I don't feel good I feel depressed

342
00:51:54,770 --> 00:52:02,119
okay he never realizes that it's not his thought
that heart is planted in his head by depression

343
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:11,040
ghost that's the example I gave okay so does
it matter if I point out to you that's depression

344
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,030
ghost right there it's doing it to you and
then he says let me you know let me worry

345
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:21,740
about the depression ghost but you don't realize
it's more depression ghost so to worry about

346
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:28,711
the cause but that way it's not going to solve
the problem so what do we teach you at your

347
00:52:28,711 --> 00:52:35,760
level Lio is not worried about voluntary
and involuntary yet at higher level you'll

348
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:43,950
be taught how to handle it lower level right
now what you do is you learn to resist the

349
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:53,089
temptation to follow to think about it that's
all if for example you talk about it's hot

350
00:52:53,089 --> 00:52:59,580
right now your body feels hot the thought
is a natural thought it's reaction to the

351
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:06,660
natural phenomena around you the environment
is hot therefore your body feels hot so therefore

352
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:16,920
you aware and the thought of being hot is
naturally generated okay that's involuntary

353
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:24,940
involuntary however for ordinary people which
they used to they said it's so hot my god

354
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:31,170
i would love to have some gelato I will have
i love to have some watermelon that's voluntary

355
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:41,500
so all you're doing right now is not to think
about it that's all and that's how you first must

356
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:48,670
learn must do in order to learn how to deal
with the false thoughts it's not understanding

357
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:54,990
it's not understanding why but it is you need
to first start do that and then you begin

358
00:53:54,990 --> 00:54:01,092
to understand why you need to do that okay
and then you can be taught but there are a

359
00:54:01,092 --> 00:54:06,720
bunch of people who would come to my temple
and say could you explain to me why I need

360
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:15,810
to understand I looked at them and say you
can't understand now I explained to you you

361
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:19,730
can't handle it

362
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:20,791
that's why I don't explain to you

363
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:30,549
it's not I cannot I can but I refuse to because
you can't handle it

364
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:35,800
you remember that movie

365
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:44,619
justice for all you remember that movie huh
and so you see

366
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:54,599
there's no need for you to understand too
much all you need to do right now Lio okay

367
00:54:54,599 --> 00:55:01,730
is one thing do one thing instead of trying
to understand why just need to look at yourself

368
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:10,040
and says I will refrain myself from pursuing
those thoughts if it's hot the thought arises

369
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:17,290
i want to have some ice cream some watermelon
cut it out you stop right there don't generate

370
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:25,660
another thought don't generate a second thought
okay yeah and then next time around when it's

371
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:31,309
hot you won't even generate the thought of
gelato or ice cream or a drink or whatever

372
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:36,869
then that's how you break it you break it
from at this stage here stop and stop them

373
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:42,660
as thought number three thought number one is
it's hot thought number two is I want something

374
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:49,720
cool okay number three is I want some gelato
for example you stop at number three as soon

375
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:55,849
you aware of thought number two you start number
three okay and that's how you meditate that's

376
00:55:55,849 --> 00:56:01,780
all you need to do know right now you can
do that you make it you don't need to understand

377
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:11,240
uh anything you just need to know what to
do understanding is not gonna help you this

378
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:17,520
guy comes to my temple trying to understand
everything and it's letting leading him nowhere

379
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,369
that's perfectly okay

380
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:29,579
okay those of you who have been with me who
are certified to have reached levels of wisdom

381
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:36,730
is because you successfully

382
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:44,880
did what I told you to do that's all but
people like him like her insist on I want

383
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:51,040
to know I want to understand good luck I can
answer you every now and then but I'm not

384
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:57,090
interested in answering you all the time sometimes
i answer sometimes I don't answer you see

385
00:56:57,090 --> 00:57:04,200
the pattern it's so fun I answer to have a
laugh but when it's useless I won't even get

386
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:11,160
a laugh out of it I won't answer this is a
waste of time knowledge is not going to help

387
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,339
you

388
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:20,510
knowledge you can pick it up from a book you
don't need me why you come to my temple asking

389
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:32,540
for knowledge I am only willing to help you
put an end to your false thinking not to know

390
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:36,550
you want to know go somewhere else Q&A go
ahead

391
00:57:36,550 --> 00:58:49,289
[Unintelligible question]

394
00:58:49,289 --> 00:58:57,319
okay now you talked about you now you brought
it up depression is a very difficult thing

395
00:58:57,319 --> 00:59:07,329
to learn to deal with at lower levels like these
people who would like to know uh they are

396
00:59:07,329 --> 00:59:13,339
totally helpless nothing they can do okay
when they go into the depression mode that's

397
00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:22,711
it they're dead meat they use totally useless
okay there's no talking to them okay at your

398
00:59:22,711 --> 00:59:30,160
level on your particular level you begin to
be taught and when you talk you understand

399
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,720
that's why I would spend time explaining to
you to begin to explain to you a little bit

400
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:41,010
because you that knowledge will be helpful
to you in your dealing with the depression

401
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:46,110
but low-level people like you in particular
I'm talking very personal now I'm talking

402
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:51,310
about you you you you I'm not talking theory
at all because I know what you're capable

403
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:55,260
of doing

404
00:59:55,260 --> 01:00:02,119
okay in your particular level you'll be taught
at a very superficial level for you to see

405
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:09,640
to see how to cope with it but it's very
involved you need to improve a lot more before

406
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:18,069
you're able to be totally out of the woods
is that complicated to imagine for me to explain

407
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:24,460
to you how to deal depression at his level
at her level it's like I would take me 10

408
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:32,560
years to describe to you and I still no end
to it it's useless okay at your level similarly

409
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:39,150
i could also spend a lot of time explaining
to you as well okay but it's useless as well

410
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:44,430
the difference between you and them is that
you when I explain now you can understand

411
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:49,829
so I will start explaining to you things you
can do

412
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:55,660
okay whereas at their low levels I don't bother
explaining to them because if I explain to

413
01:00:55,660 --> 01:01:02,180
them they still can't do it it's useless for
me to spend time explaining to these people

414
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:07,420
okay but for you I waited until you get to
this stage here and we started explaining

415
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:13,370
to you how to handle your depression and you're
able to snap out of it on your own without

416
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:22,020
any help their levels is totally helpless
they cannot do anything without our help good

417
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:28,230
luck they think they can do something about
it let them try until the day they die they

418
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:34,000
will not be able to I know how strong they
are okay I know I know how tough the problem

419
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,260
is because I was severely depressed myself
i went through all these phases myself

420
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:49,650
she depressed I see the depression I'm not
even teaching you how to deal with it yet

421
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:53,180
that's how difficult it is okay so at each
level

422
01:01:53,180 --> 01:02:00,920
you will be taught how to handle it

423
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:08,920
but no more than that because if your elementary
school what am I doing explain to you uh the

424
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:13,339
course work of a PhD level it's useless to
you

425
01:02:13,339 --> 01:02:22,599
it's useless knowledge okay

426
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:33,599
the good news is that when you get the level
where you are Qun okay and when you get higher

427
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:42,319
you'll be better be able to learn how to be
in control until then the people below you

428
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:49,970
they need help desperately not much we not
much they can do themselves that's the way

429
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:55,760
it is. unless they drug themselves up unless
they're locked up it's not a whole lot they

430
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,460
can do for themselves

431
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:05,200
that's the way it is this is why they need
people like shrink and the therapists and so

432
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:13,710
forth because they need some outside input
in order to better cope with it if they think

433
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:19,030
they can figure it out themselves they can't
they need drugs they need medication they

434
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:24,590
need some outside help because explaining
to them is not going to help them solve the

435
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:30,710
problem that's how far depression is concerned
but you we can begin to teach you how to handle

436
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:35,349
it but it's nothing yet there's still a lot
more you need to learn before you can be on

437
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:43,970
your own that's how difficult it is okay because
these beings they plant thoughts in your head

438
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:53,220
it's nothing you can do about it they're that
powerful

439
01:03:53,220 --> 01:04:00,950
yes eight um masters some of us have been
here for a while and if we still don't understand

440
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:05,980
why if we still don't understand we're still
looking at it from the wrong perspective is

441
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:10,549
it because we're lacking blessings

442
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:27,230
yes you're lacking blessings and because
they are a lot stronger than you are

443
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:34,150
the enemy's stronger you need help that's
all you have to become stronger before you

444
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:47,309
can handle them it's that simple

445
01:04:47,309 --> 01:04:53,000
and there's a fallacy in people thinking they
can handle it they can figure it out the proof

446
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:00,779
is that look at all the depressed people they're
depressed because they can't figure it out

447
01:05:00,779 --> 01:05:06,420
they can't figure out this one thing called
depression which is nothing yet compared to

448
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:12,680
the rest of their confusions they're depressed
they manic they can't even figure out how

449
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:20,089
to handle their manic depression okay and
now they're paranoid as well okay and all

450
01:05:20,089 --> 01:05:26,700
these problems they have and I'm just bringing
brought out one problem the depression they

451
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:33,529
can't even handle it let alone the other things
look at the boy one look at him you tell he's

452
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:47,109
depressed right away he says I am not feeling
good leave me alone

453
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:51,579
don't touch me

454
01:05:51,579 --> 01:06:00,690
that woman the same thing look at her I'm
depressed don't you dare look at me

455
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:05,539
this guy is different he's depressed they
said I don't feel good but I don't talk about it

456
01:06:05,539 --> 01:06:12,650
I'm a professional I'm not supposed to be
depressed I'm depressed like hell so I can't

457
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:15,970
talk about it

458
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:22,360
yes you're supposed to help depress people
you're so damn depressed you can't help people

459
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:29,049
I'm telling you at lower levels you need help
it's nothing you can do that's how difficult

460
01:06:29,049 --> 01:06:35,920
it is you cannot figure it out at higher levels
i can teach you so much it's still so much

461
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:45,760
more you need to learn before you can handle
it before you can be on your own only

462
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:52,109
only handful people I know can handle it can
be taught I haven't been able to teach them

463
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:54,839
yet

464
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:59,170
because the time is not right yet

465
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:06,200
that's how difficult it is but they'll be
out of the woods you won't you think you can

466
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:09,950
handle it good luck

467
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:15,470
I'm out of the woods okay

468
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:18,529
i went through all these levels of attacks

469
01:07:18,529 --> 01:07:38,760
you haven't how do you know could you can't
even tell how they manipulate you

470
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:48,920
okay so when false thoughts going back to slide
192 okay when you use prajna wisdom to

471
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:54,109
contemplate illuminate that's what you do
naturally with your prajna wisdom you don't

472
01:07:54,109 --> 01:08:00,700
have to think about it if you focus on something
using your past your mind and there's a way

473
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:08,349
to do that I'm not teaching you okay because
you're too stupid to be able to do it okay

474
01:08:08,349 --> 01:08:14,450
but when you reach a certain level you'll
be taught how to use a practice quantum contemplation

475
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:19,830
okay I'm looking at you spy number one you
too stupid to be taught how to do prajna

476
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:20,830
contemplation

477
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:32,150
okay but when you do that when you do it you
naturally will contemplate illuminate naturally

478
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:35,940
and when that happens

479
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:46,609
in a split second all false thoughts would
stop that is exactly what happens

480
01:08:46,609 --> 01:08:50,250
what Master HuiNeng did

481
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:56,940
here he says if you reach this level this
point here this is what's going to happen

482
01:08:56,940 --> 01:09:03,000
and this is important for you to hear about
this because when you're there then you know

483
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:16,900
exactly this is the case

484
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:24,920
okay so it means that you may have thoughts
of depression you may have thoughts of all

485
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,770
sorts of thoughts in your head

486
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:37,620
if you're able to wield your prajna wisdom
to contemplate illuminate instantaneously

487
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:52,259
everything stops

488
01:09:52,259 --> 01:10:02,989
all the false thoughts will end will disappear
will dissipate instantaneously you don't need

489
01:10:02,989 --> 01:10:10,170
to know why

490
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:18,770
you only need to be told how

491
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:28,100
who cares why

492
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:34,310
you have a lot of garbage in your house you
say why do I have so much garbage wouldn't

493
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:40,690
you rather know how do I get rid of my garbage
so that I have a clean house how does understanding

494
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:53,780
why I have so much garbage gonna help you

495
01:10:53,780 --> 01:11:03,810
and for those of you okay do not make the
same mistake do not ever come to learn about

496
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:11,960
prajna and insist on your way you should
be so grateful I tell you what to do you do

497
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:18,489
it you understand you don't do it it's your
life

498
01:11:18,489 --> 01:11:26,050
he's been here for a year and a half he said
I'm gonna do it my way what do we care how

499
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:30,180
does it help your depression you'll never
help your depression

500
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:39,490
and that's a problem with people in the world
i said I want to do it my way I figure it

501
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:47,300
out good luck there're plenty people who are smarter
than you they are therapists they're professors

502
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:54,140
they're researchers they have yet to figure
out how to deal with depression because they

503
01:11:54,140 --> 01:12:02,880
don't know enough about depression how to
put an end to it you keep on looking for tricks

504
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:03,880
here and there

505
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:15,409
that's all that's why they will never be able
to do it because they solve the the problem

506
01:12:15,409 --> 01:12:20,590
resolution is wrong

507
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:26,350
he cannot solve the depression problems like
that okay you cannot solve it by looking at

508
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:35,739
symptoms you have to look at how to cut off
the root of all these false thoughts and he

509
01:12:35,739 --> 01:12:42,300
just described to you right here that moment
it happened it will happen and you recognize

510
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:53,320
oh I know about this before okay so you believe
this okay then you should do what you told

511
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:59,010
and you should be so grateful you told about
these secrets to bring you to this point you're

512
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:12,140
not grateful good luck you figure it out yourself

513
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:19,080
what is it to me I don't need to help you
it's your life

514
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:25,780
next 193 if you recognize your self-nature
in a single moment of enlightenment you will

515
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:33,030
arrive the stage of Buddha this is referred
to the fact that Chan school says see your

516
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:40,130
nature and accomplish Buddhahood this is what
he's referring to however it is a little bit

517
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:47,340
misleading okay what he said is a lot more
accurate he says in a single moment of enlightenment

518
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:55,719
you will arrive at a stage of a Buddha the
ground of a Buddha doesn't mean you're a Buddha

519
01:13:55,719 --> 01:14:02,610
so that's why for the Chan school especially
Zen school to say see your nature and accomplish

520
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:09,449
and become a Buddha is misleading to me i
don't like to talk like that you understand

521
01:14:09,449 --> 01:14:15,989
when you see your nature doesn't mean you're
Buddha yet you're on the Buddha ground you

522
01:14:15,989 --> 01:14:22,909
arrive at the ground of the Buddha it's not
a stage of the Buddha Di here the ground okay

523
01:14:22,909 --> 01:14:28,750
Change it this is wrong

524
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:35,469
when I first explained it okay I didn't dare
Change much okay now I'm a lot more blunt

525
01:14:35,469 --> 01:14:42,370
okay I have no time to waste okay I don't
want to waste your time nor my time so what

526
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:51,100
he means here is very precise he says you
are no Buddha you only

527
01:14:51,100 --> 01:15:01,360
in the neighborhood of Buddhas that's all
you are member of a very exclusive club called

528
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:07,140
called ground of a Buddha but you are no Buddha
don't be so full of yourself

529
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:29,530
again fixed here the stage of the Buddha

530
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:32,110
the Buddha ground not the ground of the Buddha

531
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:42,429
and it arrived at the Buddha ground this is
very precise Master HuiNeng is very very

532
01:15:42,429 --> 01:15:44,960
precise he doesn't mince words

533
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:58,639
see Fo Di it's Buddha ground it's not ground of
Buddha even

534
01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:08,179
fix it

535
01:16:08,179 --> 01:16:13,969
go ahead eight from Diego master I wanted
to do it my way until one day I heard you

536
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:20,010
speaking about you don't know where to see
from the sixth patriarch that really moved

537
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:26,770
me because all my life I've been looking but
in all honestly I didn't know where to see

538
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:33,199
and I'm so grateful to you master because
now I know where I know I where I can see

539
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:40,040
and is following the instructions of master
YongHua the great good knowing advisor amituofo

540
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:45,780
that's why you need prajna to be able to
look at the problem when you have depression

541
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:51,090
yourself you have no prajna wisdom that's
why you look at it you cannot see how to fix

542
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:58,280
it and each one of you is different

543
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:03,989
therefore you need you need depression to
look at you long enough to be able to illuminate

544
01:17:03,989 --> 01:17:10,389
everything and then come up with a solution
what happened is that unless you have prajna

545
01:17:10,389 --> 01:17:20,260
wisdom you cannot fix the problem that is
why even fourth stage arhats cannot fix the depression

546
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:25,590
problem they cannot see how the what the problem
really is they need practical light practical

547
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:28,290
wisdom

548
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:35,489
i repeat four says arhats have no production
wisdom yet they cannot see how to fix it but

549
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:41,909
they can be taught they they can begin to
be taught as part of the progression towards

550
01:17:41,909 --> 01:17:50,610
opening the wisdom and so in you know in other
words at the high level or four stage or higher

551
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:58,780
okay when they have depression actually that
helps them progress even quicker the reason

552
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:05,190
i don't tell people is because I wait for
those high level people to be attacked then

553
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:21,250
i show them it's a lot faster

554
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:28,699
okay can we go back to the slideshow

555
01:18:28,699 --> 01:18:33,699
where were we

556
01:18:33,699 --> 01:18:35,219
which slide number were we at

557
01:18:35,219 --> 01:18:47,980
192 193 okay so uh

558
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:54,719
if you recognize your self-nature meaning you
being able to see your Buddha nature that

559
01:18:54,719 --> 01:19:01,139
moment right there at very single moment that
very moment right there you will arrive at

560
01:19:01,139 --> 01:19:10,489
the Buddha ground you don't accomplish Buddhahood
okay bolongni that's cut it out okay I want

561
01:19:10,489 --> 01:19:16,429
you generation for future generations you
special English Chan teachers in the future

562
01:19:16,429 --> 01:19:23,050
or you teaching your own languages do not
ever use accomplished Buddhahood that is what

563
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:31,690
the Chinese use some of the uh especially
the Japanese they are they are rampant with

564
01:19:31,690 --> 01:19:39,270
such expression okay that's wrong you're not
a Buddha not at all you're far from being

565
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:47,340
a Buddha even Master HuiNeng are so far from
being a Buddha and you you think you're close

566
01:19:47,340 --> 01:20:01,840
dream on so when you Shi Zi Xing when
you recognize yourself nature

567
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:09,040
at that moment at that moment enlightenment
okay you will arrive at Buddha ground that's

568
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:13,020
all it is

569
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:19,300
okay I'm telling you this because in the future
i want you lay people or left home people

570
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:25,600
who hear people use the word Cheng Fo accomplish
Buddhahood see your nature accomplish Buddhahood

571
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:34,639
run okay they are sales people there's no
such a thing it's contrary to what Master HuiNeng

572
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:39,150
teaches

573
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:42,600
okay he's

574
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:47,219
i don't know for sure but I feel because I've
listened to many of the great patriarchs i

575
01:20:47,219 --> 01:20:55,239
feel he's like a Buddha already I don't never
met anyone who has the kind of precision and

576
01:20:55,239 --> 01:21:04,620
the power he has when he teaches and he's
so precise here okay

577
01:21:04,620 --> 01:22:02,550
go ahead Q&A 

579
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:22,090
[Unintelligible question]

581
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:27,280
he's different Shakyamuni Buddha became a Buddha
then under the bodhi tree he's different from

582
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:35,219
us we are no Buddhas yet this is special case
he accomplished Buddhahood that's why he became

583
01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:40,840
a Buddha that's why we call him Buddha but
we never can call ourselves Buddha even though

584
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:46,630
we become enlightened we cannot we are not
Buddhas we cannot call ourselves Buddhas

585
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:51,500
that's all okay

586
01:22:51,500 --> 01:23:01,070
and so to say accomplish Buddhahood is misleading
is overselling our process and I don't like

587
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:05,969
it don't you dare talk like that okay I will
slap you in the face

588
01:23:05,969 --> 01:23:17,179
who are you trying to sell who are you trying
to con 194 good knowing advisor when you contemplate

589
01:23:17,179 --> 01:23:23,280
and illuminate with the wisdom which brightly
penetrates within and with how you recognize

590
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,280
your original mind

591
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,420
[Read sutra text in Chinese]

592
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:46,590
okay I will Change the text a little bit here
because I don't like it the way that these

593
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:52,210
people did and they combined concepts because
they don't understand what he's trying to

594
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:55,949
teach them at least not as well as I do

595
01:23:55,949 --> 01:24:06,530
let me explain to you and be prepared to fix
this good knowing advisor when you contemplate

596
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:13,320
illuminate with wisdom okay

597
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:20,780
that's correct that's he's referring to the
Guan Zhao the Zhi Hui Guan Zhao that we talked

598
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:29,090
about earlier when you contemplate illuminate
okay when you do that then inside and outside

599
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:36,770
everything is clear thoroughly that's what
this phrase means it has nothing to do with brightly

600
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:39,090
penetrates okay

601
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:58,000
okay it's not necessary this is not a good
way to translate when you use when you use

602
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,389
your

603
01:25:02,389 --> 01:25:14,270
wisdom when you use wisdom Change it the Chinese
is very very precise he does not he does not

604
01:25:14,270 --> 01:25:25,260
waste a single Chinese character in his instructions
when you contemplate with your wisdom you

605
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:27,610
contemplate and illuminate with the wisdom

606
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:38,880
oh that's what it has right here okay comma

607
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,830
then

608
01:25:42,830 --> 01:25:58,929
inside and outside everything is clear and
penetrating

609
01:25:58,929 --> 01:26:05,850
Ming Che meaning you can see clearly through nothing
can stop you nothing whatsoever

610
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:17,110
it's very powerful statement if you use your wisdom
to contemplate illuminate okay you can see

611
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:22,360
everything clearly without obstruction inside
and outside

612
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:36,449
Shi Zi Ben Xin you uh

613
01:26:36,449 --> 01:26:45,659
thus recognize your original mind

614
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:50,820
okay Change it

615
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:57,889
for the commentary

616
01:26:57,889 --> 01:26:59,659
so far so good let me explain to you

617
01:26:59,659 --> 01:28:02,800
you

618
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:08,650
okay let me elaborate for you

619
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:11,770
because

620
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:19,520
he's very precise okay he uses the words for
a reason that's why we don't want to mess

621
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:25,360
with it you don't need to combine it to make
it more fluid and whatever no no no here is

622
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:34,100
where it says this is what I mean okay there's
no need to be literary here at all can you

623
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:49,060
shrink this so that it belongs to the frame

624
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:57,580
the line here Buddha mind here that's outside
of the frame

625
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:58,739
shrink its size

626
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:08,230
there 
you go thank you okay let me explain it for

627
01:29:08,230 --> 01:29:10,060
you okay

628
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:20,070
remember earlier someone asked me uh how do
i uh look outside and this is the answer right

629
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:28,699
here okay when I explain I want to give the
answer it's consistent with this now when

630
01:29:28,699 --> 01:29:37,790
i said if you want to look outside okay then
you must learn to look inside first because

631
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:45,340
until inside is clear outside cannot be clear

632
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:50,639
okay this is what worldly people don't realize
this is what the monks and nuns don't realize

633
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:58,070
because they're not there yet and they or
they don't know how to help people get there

634
01:29:58,070 --> 01:29:59,600
yet okay

635
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:11,750
so when you use your prajna wisdom to illuminate
okay the wisdom here refers to your prajna

636
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:18,350
wisdom uh but to contemplate illuminate okay
then it doesn't matter whether you look at

637
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:24,580
yourself or you look at outside

638
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:32,860
okay when you do that whether you look at
yourself okay then you can see how the depression

639
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:39,610
ghost is attacking you for example

640
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:47,020
in theory or you look at outside in theory
you can see how they are attacking someone

641
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:59,130
else in theory only okay that's what he's
saying okay so inside and outside everything

642
01:30:59,130 --> 01:31:04,429
you look at is clear

643
01:31:04,429 --> 01:31:12,469
Ming Che, Ming is clear you understand clearly
Che is thoroughly

644
01:31:12,469 --> 01:31:21,010
okay and I Change it to penetrating because
it's not about clear thoroughly I want to

645
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:31,719
separate clear and thorough clear refers to
the fact nothing can be hidden from your prajna

646
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:40,950
wisdom your Buddha wisdom nothing can escape
that light penetrating okay refers to the

647
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:51,889
fact that you can look at the whole thing
instead of partial

648
01:31:51,889 --> 01:32:00,800
nothing can stop you

649
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:07,659
okay you thus recognize your original mind
why because when you're able to see inside

650
01:32:07,659 --> 01:32:15,429
and outside clear everything is clear and
penetrating and then you realize that's how

651
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:31,369
your original mind really functions how your
original mind can operate can do for you

652
01:32:31,369 --> 01:32:46,389
okay yes eight from Jesus should it should
not it be penetrated instead of penetrating

653
01:32:46,389 --> 01:32:55,780
penetrated is okay penetrating is uh is maybe
a little bit of a sales pitch

654
01:32:55,780 --> 01:33:02,280
but it's the same concept

655
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:06,369
penetrated

656
01:33:06,369 --> 01:33:19,949
i prefer penetrating it's more active

657
01:33:19,949 --> 01:33:27,230
okay you thus recognize your original mind
then you then here refers to that you are

658
01:33:27,230 --> 01:33:36,739
able to see the extent of your Buddha mind
how far it can go how you can depend on it

659
01:33:36,739 --> 01:33:50,429
to understand without having anyone to tell
you

660
01:33:50,429 --> 01:33:58,100
because this is the kind of knowledge you
have to develop yourself no one can tell you

661
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:08,130
this is the kind of wisdom that you must unfold
yourself so that you understand yourself

662
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:16,550
without needing any help from anyone so that's
why in order for you to get here knowledge

663
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:23,270
is not going to help you you need to know
how to get here

664
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:24,270
not why

665
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:36,940
all right next 196. the recognition of your original
mind is the original liberation the attainable

666
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:41,260
liberation of samadhi is no thought

667
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:53,630
[Read sutra text in Chinese]

668
01:34:53,630 --> 01:35:03,670
very good okay now he made the connection
that's not clear for most Chan masters okay

669
01:35:03,670 --> 01:35:12,580
this is this is uh his superior wisdom

670
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:21,060
that we don't normally have what is he talking
about he's saying the recognition your original

671
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:34,270
mind is the original liberation is the what
he's talking about is that once you can recognize

672
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:40,560
your Buddha mind your inherent Buddha mind
your fundamental Buddha mind that is your

673
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:49,300
natural state of liberation okay your original
your fundamental state of liberation meaning

674
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:57,199
what when you see that what does it mean to
you when you're able to see original mind

675
01:35:57,199 --> 01:36:03,590
you have no more suffering

676
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:12,250
all sufferings will vanish

677
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:22,449
that's called liberation liberation is a state
of absence of suffering you liberated from

678
01:36:22,449 --> 01:36:34,619
suffering so that's why originally Buddhas
have now there's a there's an ant that climbs

679
01:36:34,619 --> 01:36:41,639
on my eyeglasses okay the Buddha originally
Buddhas have no suffering whatsoever so you

680
01:36:41,639 --> 01:36:49,280
come home to your own original Buddha nature
okay when you see a Buddha nature you in the

681
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:57,989
bull in the Buddha ground therefore at that
moment right there all sufferings cease you

682
01:36:57,989 --> 01:37:07,650
are liberated that's the fundamental liberation
of Buddha ground

683
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:15,699
okay and furthermore he gave us more details
on liberation how do you attain this liberation

684
01:37:15,699 --> 01:37:23,730
another way to look at this liberation he
says is how you achieve this liberation is

685
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:33,889
you enter the prajna samadhi so until you're
able to enter prajna samadhi you don't know

686
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:43,600
what this Buddha liberation is it's not knowledge
you have to enter that samadhi

687
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:49,070
now you go back to the same concept why we
don't want to explain to you too much because

688
01:37:49,070 --> 01:37:53,670
you cannot explain to you what is this prajna
samadhi

689
01:37:53,670 --> 01:38:01,660
we all need to bring you there tell you how
to get there that's all and if you're not

690
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:06,360
willing to cross your legs and endure the leg
pains why should I tell you about this prajna

691
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:12,610
samadhi how to get there you got to be kidding
me you can't even handle one hour half an

692
01:38:12,610 --> 01:38:21,869
hour of leg pains and I can't take this is too
much pain it's too much suffering

693
01:38:21,869 --> 01:38:28,040
just tell me quickly how can I enter this prajna
samadhi

694
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:38,770
happy your way right good luck you want to
be Catholic way good luck man go ahead Q&A

695
01:38:38,770 --> 01:38:52,130
this is Buddha ground when you're there you
know the wood through the ground is not where

696
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:57,760
you stand how's that for definition

697
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:08,480
that helps right you're nowhere near it by
the way and for these people

698
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:16,160
they're like light years away yes nine master
it's amazing to think that at some point we

699
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:21,030
will be somewhere where there's absolutely
no more suffering because all we do in this

700
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:31,179
world is just suffer the Buddhas the bodhisattvas
can instantaneously put an end to their suffering

701
01:39:31,179 --> 01:39:36,739
that's why they no longer are afraid of suffering
why do you think the Buddhists come to our

702
01:39:36,739 --> 01:39:44,290
world and the bodhisattva comes to our world
if suffering bothers them they would not come

703
01:39:44,290 --> 01:39:49,429
to our world does it make sense

704
01:39:49,429 --> 01:39:53,350
they're not stupid

705
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:54,490
we are stupid they're not

706
01:39:54,490 --> 01:40:06,739
so they come to our world to suffer with us
in order to help us it's called Tong Shi

707
01:40:06,739 --> 01:40:11,690
in order to help people who are suffering
they choose to suffer the best way for them

708
01:40:11,690 --> 01:40:18,560
to help the people who are suffering is they
suffer along with them in order to help people

709
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:24,820
who are severely depressed they need to be
severely depressed themselves

710
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:36,349
severely manic themselves severely paranoid
themselves it's called Tong Shi doing same work

711
01:40:36,349 --> 01:40:42,090
that's a bodhisattva's work they're not
afraid of it they said you are suffering you

712
01:40:42,090 --> 01:40:52,380
have cancer I have cancer with you that's
what Master XuanHua did okay

713
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:58,159
I'm not afraid your cancer you were dying
cancer I would take on it on on my body so

714
01:40:58,159 --> 01:41:03,110
that you free from your suffering I suffer
on your behalf they're not afraid of suffering

715
01:41:03,110 --> 01:41:04,110
at all

716
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:13,239
because

717
01:41:13,239 --> 01:41:19,980
they can enter this prajna samadhi and free
from it all however they choose not to they

718
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:27,570
choose to suffer in order to help you to help
us

719
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:33,389
that's why they're different from us you run
away from suffering you bitch and moan

720
01:41:33,389 --> 01:41:42,260
it's too much I'm too depressed I'm so bad
i don't feel good they say give it to me give

721
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:48,840
me your pain give me your suffering I'm
not afraid of it I can carry you on my back

722
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:56,960
that's Master XuanHua for you

723
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:07,570
okay I haven't met anyone like that he's the
only one I met alive who's like that I tell

724
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:15,260
you no one else I've met is like that not
second patriarch no one else no one comes

725
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:20,300
near his level

726
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:28,110
they attained liberation and prajna samadhi
so that state liberation of all suffering

727
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:34,360
is prajna samadhi meaning they can handle
it they can enter any time they they want

728
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:39,860
to but they choose not to

729
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:50,310
and that is that state of no thought you want
to be free from suffering you want to be free

730
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:59,750
from depression pay attention you enter this
branch of and you have no thought so see how

731
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:07,610
it makes sense if you depression is a form
of I don't feel good that's hard I don't feel

732
01:43:07,610 --> 01:43:35,060
good you enter prajna samadhi that thought
is no longer so depression is

733
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:41,070
what do you want out of life more more temples
more money more recognition and you're depressed

734
01:43:41,070 --> 01:43:42,070
like hell

735
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:54,120
so confused yes nine. master, is there a cultivation
level where we can reach this or this is way

736
01:43:54,120 --> 01:44:04,550
beyond that of course many people can reach
it already

737
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:13,159
when I explained this to four years ago very
if only a handful of people could now it is

738
01:44:13,159 --> 01:44:16,670
a lot so I don't I don't brag

739
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:29,570
i talk about it because others have reached
this Buddha ground already 198 what is meant

740
01:44:29,570 --> 01:44:36,369
by no thought no thought means to view all
dharma of the mind undefiled by attachment

741
01:44:36,369 --> 01:44:40,659
the function pervades all places but is nowhere
attached

742
01:44:40,659 --> 01:44:54,830
[Read sutra text in Chinese]


744
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:59,930
okay so he explains further what is this no
thought samadhi

745
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:15,119
i have an ant that dances in front of my
eyes

746
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:22,860
no thought means to view all dharma through
the mind undefiled by attachment it's right

747
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:31,429
there is definition of no thoughts to view
meaning to perceive to look at to smell you

748
01:45:31,429 --> 01:45:40,699
smell the fragrance of Chanel number five
and you say this looks like Chanel number five

749
01:45:40,699 --> 01:45:46,550
okay I don't know why people seeing it and
why they pay so much for it can you believe

750
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:51,130
how much you're paying for something poison
you know why would you put poison on your

751
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:53,880
skin a stupid marketing thing

752
01:45:53,880 --> 01:46:02,540
doesn't even bother you sir you you want to
buy some nice perfume for your girlfriend

753
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:09,700
and the saleswoman says uh can I recommend
some poison I just say what can I recommend

754
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:18,460
some poison for your wife

755
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:23,699
i was shocked I heard about the names they
chose you girls don't seem to be bothered

756
01:46:23,699 --> 01:46:31,699
by the for me and say oh wow it gives me ideas
you know yes sir actually now the light goes

757
01:46:31,699 --> 01:46:41,989
up oh wow no um perfumes at all because it
gives me allergies um but my question is um

758
01:46:41,989 --> 01:46:43,699
you have a lot of problems son

759
01:46:43,699 --> 01:46:57,401
uh my question would be um how do I let's
say stop depression how would I do that

760
01:46:57,401 --> 01:47:03,890
you can't

761
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:12,080
you better learn Chan that's all it's a very
simple answer learn Chan and shut up

762
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:19,369
no thought okay to view all dharma so look
view all dharmas means that look at everything

763
01:47:19,369 --> 01:47:27,949
okay hear everything taste everything with
the mind undefiled by attachment okay when

764
01:47:27,949 --> 01:47:38,080
you get in contact with things you are not
giving rise to a thought of attachment precisely

765
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:47,790
okay attachment here refers to a thought of
being attached to for example you say oh i

766
01:47:47,790 --> 01:47:58,909
like this I like to have more of this that's a attachment
yes okay it's perfectly okay to say this is

767
01:47:58,909 --> 01:48:08,340
nice because your body enjoys it your taste
buds approves of it okay uh that is is not

768
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:20,409
attachment it's called being alive but for
you to say can I have three scoops of gelato

769
01:48:20,409 --> 01:48:22,060
I'm afraid that two is not enough

770
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:31,699
what you want to go to have some gelato
after

can I can I okay i'd like okay that's an attachment

772
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:43,929
okay

773
01:48:43,929 --> 01:48:50,369
and and and that's why the Chinese this is
very famous expression you keep on hearing

774
01:48:50,369 --> 01:49:06,630
about it over and over again until someday
it will it will click in you it says 
Yan Guan Sheng Se Nei Wu You

775
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:18,949
when the eyes contemplate the sound the form
inside there's nothing when you hear a sound

776
01:49:18,949 --> 01:49:33,239
when you see a form okay inside there's nothing
what does it mean

777
01:49:33,239 --> 01:49:39,360
how can there be nothing I don't know why
his disciples my show disciples or the Chinese

778
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:45,489
never asked that we American would ask immediately
what do you mean nothing I mean like I look

779
01:49:45,489 --> 01:49:55,760
at that as nothing inside then what am I how
can I see anything if it's nothing I'm seeing

780
01:49:55,760 --> 01:50:00,560
what is the matter these Chinese people they
never dare ask questions and when they ask

781
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:05,119
questions only stupid questions

782
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:14,020
yeah what does it mean is not inside there's
nothing the the eyes contemplate the sound

783
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:21,730
the form inside is nothing yes Q&A

784
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:34,099
it says You here You what

You here is to have have what

787
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:10,020
there is nothing inside

788
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:15,260
if there is nothing inside how can you see
anything

789
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:28,710
might as well be invisible might as well
be hallucination

790
01:51:28,710 --> 01:51:36,710
huh what is he talking about yes sir could
he be talking about emptiness when you look

791
01:51:36,710 --> 01:51:40,190
at something or even

792
01:51:40,190 --> 01:51:50,310
if it's emptiness then how can you see anything

793
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:55,099
you know and you know that that ant is just
saying give me the earth says could you stop

794
01:51:55,099 --> 01:51:58,389

796
01:52:06,949 --> 01:52:12,630
so you see clearly when the ant the ant is
moving clearly I'm not seeing nothing inside

797
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:13,630
there's something moving

798
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:44,989
six
[Master XianChi speak in Vietnamese]

801
01:53:00,739 --> 01:53:11,159
amituofo master, when the six sense perceives
the six dust our mind do not react to such

802
01:53:11,159 --> 01:53:20,620
things as false love or attachment no love
or hate or discrimination like we hear people

803
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:28,710
arguing we ourselves don't get afflicted it's
just like the mirror um we don't give rise

804
01:53:28,710 --> 01:53:36,130
to thought of discrimination just like but
we're not a rock

805
01:53:36,130 --> 01:53:39,909
okay

806
01:53:39,909 --> 01:53:47,869
anyone else want to try yes eight
so like when you're angry you have this tension

807
01:53:47,869 --> 01:53:57,739
inside of you it's amazing to me how ants
live they pace back and forth on my eyeglass

808
01:53:57,739 --> 01:54:04,310
lenses for no real purpose

809
01:54:04,310 --> 01:54:12,500
they clearly have no attachment whatsoever
yes eight so like when you're angry you have

810
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:19,899
this tension or pressure inside of you when
you contemplate and illuminate it that pressure

811
01:54:19,899 --> 01:54:26,070
disappears that energy disappears and then
and then it becomes empty is that okay to

812
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:35,739
express it in that way no let me explain to
you what it means okay when you see something

standards he doesn't just take anyone you
think he's like a Buddha and he should see

840
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:07,360
i take you Daoist too wow he's not that desperate
okay

841
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:11,860
forms and sound

842
01:58:11,860 --> 01:58:20,500
sound and forms eyes contemplate sound and
forms outside there's nothing inside the ears

843
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:29,170
hear the dusts and phenomena let me fix it
for you oh god

844
01:58:29,170 --> 01:58:35,560
you wanna do your way uh

845
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:43,550
do 
it

846
01:58:43,550 --> 01:58:48,980
phenomenal

847
01:58:48,980 --> 01:59:03,719
okay I explained to you my god this English
killed me

848
01:59:03,719 --> 01:59:11,159
the eyes when with your sense organ especially
your eyes when you

849
01:59:11,159 --> 01:59:17,930
see the sounds contemplate the sound uh

850
01:59:17,930 --> 01:59:21,590
not view

851
01:59:21,590 --> 01:59:22,590
contemplate

852
01:59:22,590 --> 01:59:33,659
okay and that's why I asked you a trick question
no one caught it okay when the eyes see the

853
01:59:33,659 --> 01:59:42,610
sound and forms outside which is totally incorrect
eyes cannot see the sound the eyes can contemplate

854
01:59:42,610 --> 01:59:48,780
the sound and forms outside is that clear
so the the Chinese very precise

855
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:58,881
i threw at you none of you pay
attention because none of you really uh understand

856
01:59:58,881 --> 02:00:05,770
Chinese and the Chinese are so in awe with
my Chinese which they should never be that

857
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:13,929
they don't dare question my translation anymore
okay the eyes can contemplate the sound and

858
02:00:13,929 --> 02:00:22,090
the forms on the outside nothing inside there's
nothing inside meaning that inside there's

859
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:30,739
no attachment being formed for example they
hear

860
02:00:30,739 --> 02:00:43,760
good music you know they hear a uh o fortuna
anyone likes that

861
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:52,730
that's the very famous and the famous choir
o fortuna

862
02:00:52,730 --> 02:01:03,079
i do it offline because this is all copyrighted
o fortuna okay we send you the links later

863
02:01:03,079 --> 02:01:12,070
to all the branch temples meaning all three
branch temples okay and for you to go on online

864
02:01:12,070 --> 02:01:19,310
look at what the o fortuna that sound the
sound of the choir great sound of the choirs

865
02:01:19,310 --> 02:01:28,110
or the forms outside the side the eyes contemplate
the objects outside the forms okay there's

866
02:01:28,110 --> 02:01:37,480
no attachment being formed inside of you that
it also includes rejection as well right rejection

867
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:45,969
is just the opposite of attachment right rejection
is attachment too because rejection is attachment

868
02:01:45,969 --> 02:01:52,480
to the opposite

869
02:01:52,480 --> 02:02:02,060
is that clear so inside there is no attachment
whatsoever or rejections is that clear so

870
02:02:02,060 --> 02:02:09,170
we do inside we don't say oh he's Catholic
therefore let's ignore him we simply say there's

871
02:02:09,170 --> 02:02:18,810
nothing there it's even more insulting when
you think about it just kidding okay you see

872
02:02:18,810 --> 02:02:29,050
that inside there's no attachment when the
ears hear okay the dusts and phenomena the

873
02:02:29,050 --> 02:02:37,120
mind does not know so for example when you
listen to your ear organ and whatever it is

874
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:43,800
that produces sound okay or any sort of

875
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:54,590
vocal things you can hear it's vocal or sound
phenomena the dust is what you can associate

876
02:02:54,590 --> 02:03:02,310
okay with the sensor organs phenomena something
you don't necessarily have a clear clue as

877
02:03:02,310 --> 02:03:10,770
what they are just see it just happen outside
the same thing still outside the mind does

878
02:03:10,770 --> 02:03:14,929
not know

879
02:03:14,929 --> 02:03:19,710
this is important why is the difference between
nothing inside versus the mind does not know

880
02:03:19,710 --> 02:03:32,360
if you can answer this I will give you gelato
right now today

881
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:48,389

02:03:55,350 --> 02:04:02,130
eight uh let me try so um

884
02:04:02,130 --> 02:04:15,120
maybe whatever you see or any any phenomena
you see just um uh you may not comprehend

885
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:25,820
so far so close and yet so far away anyone
yes old monk say it right I will pay for

886
02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:28,670
gelato

887
02:04:28,670 --> 02:04:35,190
because he says I don't care he says I'm above
gelato because the mind is empty when something

888
02:04:35,190 --> 02:04:44,679
happened my my reflected like a mirror reflects
so it means something happened it means formed

889
02:04:44,679 --> 02:04:53,550
my empty so something empty though like that
one record and I know that will quickly reunite

890
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:58,010
no gelato anyone else this is so precise

891
02:04:58,010 --> 02:05:02,090

02:06:17,739 --> 02:06:33,719

is it possible

901
02:06:33,719 --> 02:06:42,080
not bad still Vietnamese okay anyone else

902
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:52,400
Buddhist failed yes maybe you're not grasping
no yeah the last Vietnamese in the block master

903
02:06:52,400 --> 02:07:00,300
does that mean that that person is deaf it's
definitely this guy is brutal he says [Laughter]

904
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:07,559
when I hear something okay I would take a
screwdriver and stick it in my ear so that

905
02:07:07,559 --> 02:07:18,300
i go deaf

906
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:25,059

910
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:54,890
i don't waste my time well anyone would like
to try okay let me explain to you okay this

911
02:07:54,890 --> 02:08:03,440
is very important this is so important okay
when the ears hear the dust and the phenomena

912
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:16,020
okay the mind does not know here it refers
to the mind what does a mind do it

913
02:08:16,020 --> 02:08:23,530
thinks

914
02:08:23,530 --> 02:08:33,159
what kind of thinking does it do

915
02:08:33,159 --> 02:08:44,929
what does a mind think I told you don't raise
your what does a mind think of

916
02:08:44,929 --> 02:08:49,270
huh

917
02:08:49,270 --> 02:08:54,920
it thinks Q&A

918
02:08:54,920 --> 02:09:09,910
no I told you not to raise your hands

919
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:18,000
it thinks it knows

920
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:29,250
there's no knowledge

921
02:09:29,250 --> 02:09:41,260
you are still attached to knowledge there's
no knowledge

922
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:48,790
nothing inside here refers to no attachment
is formed that's easy to understand what your

923
02:09:48,790 --> 02:09:56,090
problem and his problem in Korea is that
you are both still attached to knowledge

924
02:09:56,090 --> 02:10:03,409
do you think knowledge is important

925
02:10:03,409 --> 02:10:08,840
that's your problem there's no knowledge

926
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:13,050
the low-level people they think they need
to know they need to understand they need

927
02:10:13,050 --> 02:10:20,770
to have knowledge because they're confused
you are still attached to that concept that's

928
02:10:20,770 --> 02:10:25,530
why you cannot answer this that's why you
don't know Xin Bu Zhi the mind does not know

929
02:10:25,530 --> 02:10:30,139
the mind has no knowledge

930
02:10:30,139 --> 02:10:35,440
the mind is no longer attached to knowledge

931
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:46,599
isn't that right do you attach to your knowledge

932
02:10:46,599 --> 02:11:09,290
[Master XianChi speak in Vietnamese]
you are referring to nothing inside, you are not referring to mind not know

933
02:11:09,290 --> 02:11:17,199
why do the Chinese say Nei Wu You and Xin Bu Zhi
because they're two different things Nei Wu You

934
02:11:17,199 --> 02:11:24,730
here is low level where you are you got it
but a high level Xin Bu Zhi you are not there

935
02:11:24,730 --> 02:11:29,699
yet he's not there yet in Korea

936
02:11:29,699 --> 02:11:35,160
i have proof you cannot you cannot understand
this when you're there you understand what

937
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:41,949
i mean you still disagree with me you still
don't understand he still does not get it

938
02:11:41,949 --> 02:11:45,739
because you deep down you are attached to
knowledge

939
02:11:45,739 --> 02:11:55,460
you tell yourself how can master know so much

940
02:11:55,460 --> 02:12:00,480
i know nothing

941
02:12:00,480 --> 02:12:04,920
before I come here I don't know what I'm going
to be talking about I want to talk because

942
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:10,449
of you because of her because of these idiots
without you I don't know what to talk

943
02:12:10,449 --> 02:12:15,880
about every time I prepare for lecture you
know what I do I look at the screen my mind

944
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:22,869
goes lying as a what should I talk about today
and if I don't deliver today they will leave

945
02:12:22,869 --> 02:12:30,590
me and go to DRBA temples that's how i
know there's constant pressure every day every

946
02:12:30,590 --> 02:12:36,010
time every weekend you know I have spies coming
in here and says see let's see what else he's

947
02:12:36,010 --> 02:12:41,969
got to give us today he doesn't give it to
me I leave and for 15 years he's been coming

948
02:12:41,969 --> 02:12:46,969
in my temple and he says the same attitude
okay what have you got for me if you don't

949
02:12:46,969 --> 02:12:54,040
give me something knowledge some new knowledge
i will leave

950
02:12:54,040 --> 02:13:18,800
right huh spy number one huh master doesn't
know anything why should I come right

951
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:22,250
see he still doesn't get it

952
02:13:22,250 --> 02:13:26,889
Z do you get it

953
02:13:26,889 --> 02:13:40,090
see he's thinking he's thinking he's thinking

954
02:13:40,090 --> 02:13:55,630
no attached to knowledge Zhi here is knowledge

955
02:13:55,630 --> 02:14:06,940
no he doesn't get it I'm very specific the
mind has no knowledge

956
02:14:06,940 --> 02:14:15,820
only stupid people ask to know why ask for
knowledge if you get a high level like a little

957
02:14:15,820 --> 02:14:39,449
bit higher than yours they have no more knowledge

958
02:14:39,449 --> 02:14:46,389
the first level is Nei Wu You which is your level
you have no attachment you can let go easily

959
02:14:46,389 --> 02:14:53,390
but your mind used to seeking knowledge that's
where you are right now that's why you are

960
02:14:53,390 --> 02:15:04,300
where you are right now the Chinese are very precise
they never if it's not it's not for a reason

961
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:13,849
they would not bother composing these this
couplet okay Yan as opposed to ear okay

962
02:15:13,849 --> 02:15:22,889
eye is opposed to ear Guan is supposed to Ting
okay because basically it's all outside outside

963
02:15:22,889 --> 02:15:30,190
knowledge is it clear it is so precise it's
so beautiful everything it makes sense one

964
02:15:30,190 --> 02:15:41,820
is inside this requires wisdom okay Sheng
here is is is the the uh the physical event

965
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:50,190
here is all sorts of physical events okay
that pertains to knowledge so here refers

966
02:15:50,190 --> 02:15:58,139
to form okay it's low level you have attachments
at the sound and the form high level you attach

967
02:15:58,139 --> 02:16:06,820
to the Chen and the Shi the dust and the
phenomena and the mind okay is no longer concerned

968
02:16:06,820 --> 02:16:07,929
with such knowledge

969
02:16:07,929 --> 02:16:15,380
you're not there yet don't bother raising
your hands I'm not going to entertain your

970
02:16:15,380 --> 02:16:23,659
thoughts I'm way beyond beyond my my time
time slot yes eight from Jane Xin Bu Zhi should

971
02:16:23,659 --> 02:16:25,989
it be translated to mind does not know

972
02:16:25,989 --> 02:16:40,620
uh is that what you wrote down right there
mind not know mind does not know

973
02:16:40,620 --> 02:16:43,420
this is my Vietnamese English you don't like
it tough luck

974
02:16:43,420 --> 02:16:52,200
okay I can't believe these Chinese people
how do you how dare you question my Vietnamese

975
02:16:52,200 --> 02:17:06,280
English you at best English

976
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:09,910
different levels of wisdom

977
02:17:09,910 --> 02:17:13,860
you don't understand that's why you don't
get it yet he doesn't understand in Korea

978
02:17:13,860 --> 02:17:19,330
either that's why you still need me I'm hoping
you understand so that I can retire don't

979
02:17:19,330 --> 02:17:27,319
think I don't want you to know I want you
to know but you're not there yet

980
02:17:27,319 --> 02:17:32,790
you don't get it yet someday you will but
there's a reason why they have two of them

981
02:17:32,790 --> 02:17:40,790
there's a couplet here this is low level where
you are you understand here you don't understand

982
02:17:40,790 --> 02:17:49,030
that's the nature of your ignorance and his
ignorance

983
02:17:49,030 --> 02:17:54,120
you don't mess with these Chan people they
look at you and they ask you I ask you a question

984
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:59,609
okay and now you understand why these people
never asked master XuanHua if I were there

985
02:17:59,609 --> 02:18:07,639
i would ask him master why is there Nei Wu You and 
and Xin Bu Zhi why muscle why don't

986
02:18:07,639 --> 02:18:15,120
simply say uh combine everything into one
sentence and then they yo they're totally

987
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:18,899
different

988
02:18:18,899 --> 02:18:26,740
that's why there must be two sentences one
is the first level and next is

989
02:18:26,740 --> 02:18:36,210
for high levels okay we stop here today thank
you everyone we're over time way over time

990
02:18:36,210 --> 02:18:36,450
