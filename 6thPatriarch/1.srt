Um.

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,439
Boy: "Excuse me, Sir.

3
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,640
It's not recording."

4
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,840
Master Yong Hua: "It will be."

5
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Boy: "Is it gonna record?"

6
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,000
Master Yong Hua: "Yes." Boy: "[?unintelligble?] record it."

7
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,040
Master Yong Hua: "It's going to be recorded." Boy: "How?"

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
Master Yong Hua: "Machine over there." Boy: [?Unintelligble?]

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,680
Master Yong Hua: "Yeah, right there. yeah."

10
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,160
Boy: "I don't see it."

11
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,160
Master Yong Hua: "Yeah, right there, behind, behind those

12
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,160
gentlemen."

13
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,319
Boy: "Oh?

14
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Wow."

15
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,519

16
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,840

We

18

respectfully request

wonderful Dharma,

40
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,720
In a hundred thousand million aeons is

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,040
difficult to encounter,

42
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,000
Now that I'm able to see and hear, I will

43
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,839
receive and maintain it. I vow to fathom

49
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,800
Venerable left-home people, and all good-knowing advisors, Emituofo. [Chinese] [Vietnamese] Hello everyone. Today is the 23rd of October, 

50
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,680
2021. Uh.

51
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,440

52
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,600
We are gathered here to start discussing the

53
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,800
Sixth Patriarch Sutra, uh,

54
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,800
one of the, uh, uh,

55
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,399
most important, uh, 

56
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,560
document, of

57
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,800
Buddhist scripture on

58
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,120
the Sudden Teaching.

59
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,560
Okay? Which is a distinctive

60
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,560
characteristics of the Chan school of

61
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,040
Mahayana. Uh.

62
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,040
Alright. So the full name is "The Six

63
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,800
Patriarch's Dharma Jewel

64
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,800
Platform Sutra," okay? Uh.

65
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,680
And on slide, let's see-

66
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,480
We are redoing this because we did this

67
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,920
like four years ago, four plus years ago,

68
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,600
and when we first started for uh, for uh,

69
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,480
over four years ago,

70
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,279

71
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,440
my intention was to honor my

72
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,480
late Chinese teacher, Master Xuan Hua, and

73
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
so, uh

74
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,959
who was hiding under his shadow, and

75
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,880
trying to explain, simply try to

76
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:49,440
elaborate what he meant. Was my intention.

77
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,959
And now the conditions have changed, a

78
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,480
little bit.

79
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:57,360
So now, we try to

80
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,959
explain the Sutra from the

81
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,160
American Mahayana perspective, instead of

82
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,360
Chinese Mahayana perspectives. So,  uh,

83
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,720
that's why we, we, we are, uh, we, I, we

84
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,360
feel that it's

85
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,760
worthwhile to do it again and explain it

86
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,240
in a way for, uh, 

87
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,079
people in the 21st century, especially

88
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,839
Western-educated people. I'm not Chinese,

89
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,560
but,

90
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,920
but, um, but, um

91
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,720
I try. I'm sort of a hybrid person. I try

92
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,480
to

93
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,200
bridge the gap between the East,

94
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,399
Eastern culture and the Western culture.

95
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,800
And uh,

96
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,880
luckily for us, we have a lot of very

97
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,519
competent, uh, 

98
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Chinese-speaking, uh, uh,

99
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,760
people as well, so, and Taiwanese as well. Uh.

100
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,240
No

101
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,240
disrespect intended to the Taiwanese

102
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,240
people. Uh. [laughs] Ah, ah.

103
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
So,

104
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,040
so,

105
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,680
it is a collaborative effort. I hope

106
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,360
you all pitch in, and we, we will- 

107
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,360
each other- 

108
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,839
we learn from each other, and make

109
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,240
this a richer and more rewarding

110
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,839
experience. In particular, this is a very

111
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,320
auspicious because,

112
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,839
uh, we also have, hm,

113
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,279
the Korean audience as well. Ah, Korean is a

114
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,200
culture, a Buddhist culture, that

115
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,760
emphasizes Chan meditation, in

116
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,440
particular the Hua Tou. They put a lot of

117
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,800
emphasis on that. Uh.

118
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,600
And uh-

119
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,399
and so, this is a in a small way, a

120
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,360
little bit of contribution to their Chan

121
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,480
culture, and they call it Seon, Seon culture as

122
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,480
well. Okay. So, welcome all of you, thank

123
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,079
you very much, okay.

124
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,079
God, when you get on your knees like that I go "Urgh!" [laughs]

125
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,639
Is it me? [laughs]

126
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,720
Thank you.

127
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,920
Alright. Like so-

128
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,959
uh- six- uh- that's uh- Let's jump right into it. Uh.

129
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,000
The Sixth Patriarch is the sixth patriarch

130
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,320
from a Chinese lineage. Uh.

131
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,160
The first patriarch was Indian. That's 

132
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,639
Venerable Great Master Mahakashyapa. Uh.

133
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,480
So he's he first patriarch of the 

134
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,560
orthodox line,

135
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,680
lineage of, uh,

136
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,680
of Orthodox Buddhism. So,

137
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,800
the very important thing here we need to

138
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,320
take away from this is that, this is uh,

139
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,399
where, if you want to learn Buddhism,

140
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,279
if you want to learn Mahayana, this is

141
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,600
where

142
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,320
you should go and look for

143
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,639
good teachers, these patriarchs.

144
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,519
Alright? So, it started in India and

145
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,839
then

146
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,839
eventually it was transferred from India

147
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,959
to China and,

148
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,480
and to-

149
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,360
via Venerable

150
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,560
Great Master Bodhidharma, the 28th

151
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Patriarch.

152
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,079
Okay?

153
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,399
Is there a question from JMMT or is it just my

154
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,040
imagination? Because the sign keeps on

155
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,360
flashing that, you know.

156
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Or is it just uh, Malcolm who cannot

157
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,279
decide uh,

158
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:08,240
between Seoul and, and, and, and uh

159
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,959
JMT? Huh?

160
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:15,279
Anyway, is it you Malcolm?

161
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,279
Yeah! I recognize his flaming hair.Yeah

162
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,160
Yeah now, today- yesterday is that, uh, it's

163
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,160
in Seoul and today he's in- at uh, Jewel

164
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,920
Mountain Temple.

165
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,120
Yeah, hello!

166
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,370
Yeah.

167
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,950
The world traveler.

168
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,950
[laughs] Uh.

169
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,160
Alright, so, the Venerable Great Master

170
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,800
Bodhidharma brought the Mahayana,

171
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,000
transferred Mahayana from India to China,

172
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,279
because,

173
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,639
that's at the time, that's where the

174
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,079
next

175
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,399
competent

176
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,000
students would be found.

177
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,600
This is a problem with the patriarch, they

178
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,639
need to go

179
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,680
where

180
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,560
the students are, so that they can teach

181
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,199
them and train them, okay? So

182
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,199
at that time, uh, uh,

183
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,519
Venerable Bodhidharma had to go to India- uh- 

184
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,759
from India to China. He abandoned India,

185
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,399
his Indian disciples,

186
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:20,240
went cold turkey to China on his own, by

187
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:24,639
himself. No entourage, okay? Uh.

188
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:28,240
And he went there, and, and, and to transfer

189
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,440
the Indian Mahayana knowledge

190
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,000
to

191
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,000
the Chinese uh. The First Patriarch. So

192
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,480
he became the first Chinese Patriarch.

193
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,160
So he's like holding two hats: Indian

194
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,959
Patriarch, 28th Patriarch from India, and

195
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,920
first Chinese Patriarch. Alright?

196
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,839
So...

197
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,399
And he transferred it to

198
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,160
the, uh, uh, the 

199
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,079
second

200
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,839
Chinese Patriarch by the name of Hui Ke.

201
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,560
Okay? So

202
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,959
what did he transfer? Uh.

203
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,480
They didn't quite say it. But what he

204
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,240
transferred

205
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,600
is,

206
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,798
had to be

207
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:16,160
the Sudden Teaching.

208
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:19,760
Mahayana is about the Sudden Teaching.

209
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,199
If you don't have the Sudden Teaching,

210
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,280
you cannot teach Mahayana.

211
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,799
If you don't understand the Sudden

212
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,799
Teaching, you cannot, uh, 

213
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,640
really, uh,

214
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,640
train the next generation at all.

215
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,679
And that's a constraint, and that's why, uh,

216
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,360
when we got to the Sixth Patriarch,

217
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,799
the Sixth Chinese Patriarch, 

218
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:49,039
Venerable, Venerable Hui Neng, okay?

219
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,000
He was there around the 8th century AD.

220
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,760
Alright?

221
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,760
So now on slide number four. Uh,

222
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,960
in contrast,

223
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,320
if you look at the Hinayana hierarchy of

224
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,400
Buddhism, uh,

225
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,559
then you have to, you want to learn

226
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,360
Hinayana, then

227
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,480
I

228
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,320
have tremendous respect for the Thai

229
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,880
people, the Thai

230
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,039
Buddhist system. Hmm, ah,

231
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,760
why is that? Because

232
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,840
they have a long history

233
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,640
of training people. Uh,

234
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,520
I

235
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,160
met, uh, 

236
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,400
some of the recent, uh,

237
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,880
the recent head monks,

238
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,559
Thai monks and uh,

239
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,919
they are very good. They are, they are

240
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,480
really, uh, pretty good levels of Arhats.

241
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,440
Fourth-stage Arhats. And therefore, that

242
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,559
system consistently passed on that

243
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,640
knowledge to the next generation. This is

244
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,360
key to Buddhism.

245
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,160
Buddhism is about once you have the

246
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,280
knowledge, once you have the wisdom, it is,

247
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,160
behooves upon you to pass it on to the next

248
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,679
generation. You cannot

249
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,520
let it discontinue at all.

250
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,679
So that knowledge

251
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,480
about the Sudden Teaching

252
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,919
in Mahayana must be passed on to next

253
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,120
generation, okay? And uh,

254
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,000
similarly, uh,

255
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,160
in Hinayana, they have a way of training

256
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,679
people so that uh,

257
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,720
they have uh, 

258
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,760
tremendous success. They produce a lot of

259
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,080
Fourth-stage Ahats and probably Pretyekabuddhas

260
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,919
as well, even though, I haven't

261
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,320
met any yet, okay.

262
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,440
So that's the distinctive characteristics

263
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,440
over there. And, um, 

264
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,080
and uh,

265
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,200
uh,

266
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,200
so they have a lot of, uh, Thai, uh, 

267
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,559
jargon here. They're, they're big shots.

268
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,559
And uh, just between us, uh, don't say this

269
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:56,000
don't quote me, okay? Among them

270
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,000
are Bodhisattvas. Shhhhh...

271
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,360
they're gonna be offended. [laughs]

272
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,799
I saw some of them are Bodhisattvas.

273
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,880
Okay? You know why it's important?

274
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:15,919
Because the Bodhisattvas

275
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,679
help defend them against the demonic

276
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,120
perversion

277
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,720
in the system.

278
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,880
Because they spot those things and say,

279
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,080
"No, no, no, no, cut this off." This is why you

280
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,280
call the doctor and cut off the limb.

281
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,080
"This is a bad limb, cut it off, cut it off!"

282
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,360
Okay?

283
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,400
Otherwise,

284
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,400
the system will be, uh, uh, uh,

285
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,440
what's the word, huh, Master Xian Jie?

286
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,799
Tainted? What else?

287
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,919
Master Xian Jie: "Um, I'm not sure what we're looking for

288
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,919
right now, sorry."

289
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,720
Master Yonghua: [sigh] Okay, I'll, you know...

290
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,400
What is the more polite term for

291
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,400
polluted?

292
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,640
Deeriorated, is too uh, too scholarly.

293
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,880
Master Xian Jie: "Is it like corrupted?"

294
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,559
Master Yonghua: Corrupted! Thank you.

295
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,880
It's very serious.

296
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,480
If you let corruption

297
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,159
sneak in,

298
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,200
that's the beginning of the end.

299
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,760
Just like uh,

300
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,240
speaking of uh, governments and policy,

301
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,720
and so forth, you know, we go to another

302
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,400
country, and try to change government and

303
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,080
change uh, the political system, and all. And, and

304
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,720
you don't guard against corruption in

305
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,360
government, that's it. It will never work.

306
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,960
Never ever. Never happened, never worked in

307
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,280
Vietnam, for example,

308
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,280
okay? Never workd in any country as a

309
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,320
matter of fact. If you have corruption in

310
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,240
the system, the system will fall. So what

311
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,240
happened, never mind about politics and

312
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,080
you know,

313
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,440
so what happened is that,

314
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,520
in the Thai system, they have

315
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,080
Bodhisattvas

316
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,600
disguising themselves as Arhats, and

317
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,840
they are not in power. They only serve in

318
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,080
advisory roles and,

319
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,960
and, and that's why the system is so

320
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,960
healthy, so strong, because of that reason.

321
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,679
They have protection. Because if you them

322
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:30,080
leave alone, it alone to the Arhats, the

323
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:33,039
Arhats can still be fooled.

324
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,640
Okay? So, so, that's why, that's why in

325
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,000
terms of Hinayana, I highly recommend you if

326
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,640
want to uh, 

327
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,760
learn the Maha-, uh, Hinayana thing,

328
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,640
go to Thailand. I highly recommend it,

329
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,679
okay?

330
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,760
And they have a council and I know, briefly

331
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,480
about it, I met the Tha- head

332
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,720
guy from the Thai council, and I said,

333
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,720
yeah, he's, he's a fourth-stage Arhat for sure.

334
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,200
And, and, uh,

335
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,600
he has spiritual penetrations as

336
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,280
well, and so forth, okay? So these peopleaare 

337
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,919
for real folks.

338
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,120
They're worth, they're worthy of

339
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,520
our offerings, okay? I would not hesitate

340
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,480
to make offerings though. Okay?

341
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,919
Uh, uh,

342
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,039
And uh, Supreme Patriarch,

343
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,880
is uh,

344
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,559
this uh, Great Rattanakosin, okay,

345
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,320
uh,

346
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,559
since

347
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,120
2017, and so forth. Look how young he is,

348
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,159
yeah, young looking he is. Hm?

349
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,360
Okay?

350
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,520
And,

351
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,360
uh, alright, so,

352
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,159
so that's the Buddhism right there. If

353
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,760
you want, you are a believer in Hinayana,

354
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,799
okay, and you say Mahayana is 

355
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,720
not for me, go to Thailand. I don't care

356
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,279
whoever you are, okay.

357
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,840
It's a, it's a great place to learn.

358
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,840
Yes Sir, yellow.

359
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,760
Speaker Yellow: "Be the more proper adjective,

360
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,200
corrupt?" Master Yonghua: Yeah, corrupt.

361
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,320
Yeah thank you. Thank you very much.

362
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,840
Alright. Uh,

363
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,279
I stand uh,

364
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,279
corrected. I should be more corrupt, okay?

365
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,080
Corrupted is, uh,

366
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,679
is uh,

367
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,520
not quite correct.

368
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,600
Okay? Uh.

369
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,279
Alright.

370
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,400
So, uh,

371
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,480
so going back to our small world of

372
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,120
Mahayana. Because

373
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,200
in the West right now, Master Xuan Hua

374
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,640
transmitted his knowledge

375
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,080
of the

376
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,159
Sudden Teaching

377
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,480
to

378
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,360
this country, already.

379
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,720
Okay? Meaning that,

380
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,400
the fact

381
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,840
from a profess- from a professional

382
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,480
perspective,

383
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,559
the people here are better recipients of

384
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,880
that teaching, then

385
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,200
the people back in his country.

386
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,000
It's a fact, okay.

387
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,240
No disrespect intended for the Taiwanese

388
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,919
either.

389
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,159
Alright? So,

390
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:03,279
so he had to go to this country, to the

391
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,720
U.S. to transfer the Sudden Teaching Dharma

392
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,039
Door.

393
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,600
Okay so, as Americans here, American has

394
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,039
no color, skin color by the way. As you

395
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,960
can look around you,

396
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,520
there's only,

397
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,640
hardly any white-colour skins here at

398
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,200
all.

399
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,520
You see? And that's the nature of American

400
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,279
Buddhism. American Buddhism, people think

401
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,200
American is like, you know, it

402
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,320
must be Caucasian. No! American is a mixed,

403
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,520
you know,

404
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,440
thing and, and, and, and uh, that's what

405
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,480
makes America

406
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:42,159
superior, in my s-, in my, my, my, in my mind, is

407
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,240
that the ability to absorb and embrace

408
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,919
everything. That is the spirit of Mahayana

409
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,919
right there.

410
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,480
Okay, so he had to go to this country,

411
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,559
Master Xuan Hua, okay? Uh, 

412
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,120
brought this Chinese

413
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,200
Mahayana to the U.S., in particular he

414
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,640
brought the Dharma door of the Sudden

415
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,320
Teaching,

416
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,400
okay. Sudden teaching meaning that

417
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,360
those of you who are not familiar with

418
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,120
this, uh,

419
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,279
Sudden Teaching meaning that with this

420
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,640
teaching, teaching, meaning,

421
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,679
you have to hear it, you have to, uh, you have

422
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,320
to, uh, someone has to speak it, okay?

423
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,159
Okay? And when you hear this,

424
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,559
when you read this,

425
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,039
you can attain

426
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,039
Enlightenment.

427
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,080
Suddenly.

428
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,520
Okay?

429
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:33,600
Only in Mahayana can you have that.

430
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,640
Okay? And so this uh, the Sixth Patriarch

431
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,279
taught

432
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,880
this method of Sudden Enlightenment,

433
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,919
if you will,

434
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,799
okay?

435
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,000
And uh, and 

436
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,000
so, uh, this Dharma door here

437
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,960
actually has many access,

438
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,480
access routes.

439
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:53,919
It leads to that door called Sudden

440
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,240
Enlightenment, but to get there it has many

441
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,480
pathways, if you will.

442
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,559
Alright?

443
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,279
Questions? This is very important. This is

444
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,840
a momentous moment

445
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:09,360
in China

446
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:13,279
when uh, um, Great Master Bodhidharma

447
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:16,640
went to China and decided, "Ah,

448
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,880
I'm gonna teach Hui Ke, Great Master Hui Ke,

449
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,240
this Sudden Teaching thing," and then

450
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,200
Master Hui Ke then transferred it to the

451
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,440
Third Patriarch, who transferred it to the Fourth

452
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,880
Paatriarch, who transferred it to the Fifth

453
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,919
Pariarch,

454
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,559
Master Hong Ren, who then transferred it, 

455
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,880
that Sudden teaching to Master Huineng.

456
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,000
And we'll find out a little bit later.

457
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,200
Alright?

458
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:46,240
So this is very, very important. And

459
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,240
by the way, okay, as Americans, okay, uh, uh,

460
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,679
the mindset should be that we should be

461
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,600
grateful to the Chinese for this gift.

462
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,480
Because you know, it's a gift

463
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,679
that will have tremendous consequences

464
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,720
for us,

465
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,600
our generation, as well our children's

466
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,960
generation, and further, further down the

467
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,240
road as well,

468
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,200
okay? This is very, very critical, uh, 

469
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,279

470
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,080
heritage, that we,

471
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,919

472
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,279
we are, we are leaving behind, okay? So 

473
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,880
that's why we,

474
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,760
uh since, uh,

475
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,679
since Master Xuan Hua didn't really

476
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,159
elaborate that much about the Sudden

477
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,960
Teaching when he taught this, in

478
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,880
how long ago? I don't remember.

479
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,600
It, the...

480
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,520
Anyone knows? He taught this, he

481
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,000
explains the Sutra, he explained the Sixth Patriarch

482
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,080
Sutra, as one of the popular

483
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,919
explanations out there, for,

484
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,840
in Mahayana.

485
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,279
A lot of people, Buddhists and

486
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,520
non-Buddhists like

487
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,880
would read up on his books. They find it

488
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,760
very, very, uh,

489
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,880
interesting, very insightful. Hm. And.

490
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,600

491
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,840
But

492
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,919
he never really

493
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,440
elaborated that much on the Sudden

494
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:03,200
Teaching, which is

495
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:07,039
what uh,Venerable Hui Neng specialized in doing.

496
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:10,080
Okay. So we'll dwelve on that side.

497
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,080
Number eight. Uh.

498
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:16,399
And at the time,

499
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,360
at the time, Buddhism uh,

500
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,640
was

501
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,279
there in China already, okay? But

502
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,799
just like nowadays, just like typically

503
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,080
what happens, uh,

504
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,840
that, 

505
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,960
people studied books, studied scriptures

506
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:37,840
and did ceremonies, and so what it's

507
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:42,000
called very superficial cultivation. Okay?

508
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:46,799
Substance is what Mahayana is about, okay?

509
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,279
It's, it's, it's a, it's, uh, it's about, uh, uh,

510
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:52,399
the core, your core,

511
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,520
your heart. It's not, it's not about

512
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:58,559
appearances, not about temples, it's not

513
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,480
about fame, reputation.

514
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,480
Alright? Go ahead

515
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,480
Korea.

516
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,960
JMT.

517
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,760
Speaker from JMT: "Good morning from Korea." Master Yonghua: Good morning.

518
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,360
Good afternoon to you too.

519
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,110
Good morning there and good afternoon

520
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,200
here.

521
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:42,240
[Laughs]

522
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,559
Speaker from JMT: "Ma- Master, did Bodhidharma walk from-

523
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,860
walk all the way on foot, from India to

524
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,120
China?"

525
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,880

526
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,039
Master Yong Hua: Not true.

527
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,600
It's uh, it's a myth,

528
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,520
What actually happened, it sounded good,

529
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,919
but what did happen is that- the Chinese

530
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,480
would like you to believe that he walked.

531
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,200
But it's not true.

532
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,679
Actually what happened, he boarded

533
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,799
a boat.

534
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,799
He didn't swim either.

535
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,559
And then he walked to Vietnam, that's

536
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,559
true. [laughs]

537
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,880
Yeah.

538
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,159
Monks couldn't, couldn't, couldn't uh, couldn't ride

539
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,120
horses,

540
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,159
they can't, they can't ride horses.

541
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,559
Only for pets, but not for riding uh

542
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,519
that's how they keep horses. Speaker: "I have one more question."

543
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:36,000
Yes go ahead, uh, uh,

544
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,000
flaming

545
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,880
hair.

546
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,960
Speaker "flaming hair": "Uh, Master this is more of

547
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,559
a comment.

548
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,799
There's a,

549
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,120
there's a rapper I listened to and he, he

550
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,080
wrote a book and Bodhidharma was

551
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,080
mentioned,

552
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,640
and he's- he was- that's where I got that

553
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,159
from. He walked from India to China

554
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,919
and um

555
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,559
he actually mentioned Chan in the book

556
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,279
and that Zen came from Chan,

557
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,679
like the Japanese Zen. So I thought that

558
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,200
was pretty cool. That he um-"

559
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,480

560
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,440
Master Yonghua:  This is where? 

561
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,600
A rap song?  Speaker "flaiming hair": " It kinda- Sorry, it's a, it's a rapper that got me

562
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,279
into um, the Asian culture, a long

563
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,519
time ago." Master Yonghua: Did I hear right? You, you

564
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,360
listen to rap?

565
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,650
Speaker "flaming hair": "Not as much anymore."

566
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,320
Master Yonghua: Good for you.

567
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,840
[Laughs]

568
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,039
I'm open-minded but there're certain

569
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,039
things I just can't stand. [Audience laughs]

570
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,399
Just kidding, just kidding. [Master Yong Hua laughs]

571
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,600
Alright very good. Yes Wei Mountain. Oh

572
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,519
god.

573
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,960
I always get in trouble when I joke too

574
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,519
much.

575
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,880
Speaker from Wei Mountain Temple: "Master when did Bodhidharma went to

576
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,480
Vietnam?"

577
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,080
Master Yonghua: In Vietnam?

578
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,240
Oh my, my, my province. Huế [?Vietnamese spelling?]

579
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,279
Definitely. [laughs]

580
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,279
Central Vietnam.

581
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,600
No hesitation, no doubt.

582
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,200
Yes, uh, over here black.

583
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,720
Speaker Black: "So it is the

584
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,760
tradition

585
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,600
story that Bodhidharma came to China, um,

586
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,519
well actually, while he was travelling to

587
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,519
China he traveled-

588
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,720
wait no sorry- I think when he came to

589
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,360
China he um, came by a piece of leaf and

590
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,240
then" Master Yong Hua: No. Speaker Black: "-went across the water, right?" Master Yonghua: No.

591
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,559
No, no, no, no, no, no. You Chinese, nice try.

592
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

593
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,480
You're distorting the fact, you're

594
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,559
China's, China person.

595
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,039
No no. You can't, you you, can't sneak that

596
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:37,760
in. No, no, no, no, no. Speaker Black: "I think uh uh-" Master Yong Hua: He

597
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:40,399
boarded a boat. Speaker Black: "I think-" Master Yonghua: A Viking boat. [laughs]

598
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,480
Speaker Black: "Yeah um it was it was quoted as an

599
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:46,159
example of um,

600
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,559
you actually can show um, spiritual power

601
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,640
as a Chan Master, uh,

602
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,440
to teach people."

603
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,399
Master Yonghua: When he was in China, he did cross a

604
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,559
river on a leaf, that's true.

605
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:01,440
See, your Chinese history is so mixed. Speaker Black: "I thought I

606
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,519
thought it was Indian ocean, I guess I got it wrong, Master." 

607
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,399
Master Yonghua: Indian ocean is an ocean, it's not a

608
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,960
river, my dear, okay? Speaker Black: "Yeah yeah okay." Master Yonghua: Get your Chinese

609
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,440
facts straight please.

610
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,679
Alright yeah, he did cross, actually, it,

611
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,118
that's very famous, he, he, had a, there's 

612
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,638
plenty of drawings of him

613
00:34:17,118 --> 00:34:22,960
on a leaf when he walked across the water. Speaker Black: "Yeah. Oh I think uh that's when

614
00:34:20,638 --> 00:34:24,878
Master Yonghua: That's when, how he showed off. Like, you know, 

615
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,679
Chinese. They show off.

616
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:29,280
Speaker Black: "He uh, he came from the north when after

617
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,599
he talked with Lian Wu Di

618
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,040
and then he pissed off Lian Wu Di and

619
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,520
then he left, um,

620
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,839
the Northern China to go to Southern

621
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,839
China. I think that's where the the story

622
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,158
of the one leaf crossed the river." Master Yonghua: Yeah

623
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:46,158
he crossed a river and on, on a leaf,

624
00:34:42,158 --> 00:34:51,280
that's true, okay. Yeah and, and uh, 

625
00:34:46,158 --> 00:34:51,280
not clear on how what propelled him, okay? [laughs]

626
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:55,760
Alright? But it's true that he did

627
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,560
cross, uh, uh, uh,

628
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,359
water on a leaf. That's pretty impressive,

629
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,560
okay?

630
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,280
And, uh.

631
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,760
And so,

632
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,720
so, he was actually pretty desperate

633
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,320
looking for someone, so

634
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,160
"Anyone please, who wants to learn

635
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,400
Mahayana from me, take it off my

636
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,680
hands." Okay? And the Chinese was like "No, no, you're too

637
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,520
black. I mean

638
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,280
your skin too dark.

639
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,200
We don't trust you." Uh.

640
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,200
So you know,

641
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,680
so he really struggled, uh,

642
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,440
and finally he found a yellow soul, I

643
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,599
mean a Chinese soul, [audience laughter]

644
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,520
who took it from him,

645
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,240
okay? And we're grateful for that.

646
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,200
My point here is that with all due respect

647
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,240
okay, I personally, I'm grateful to

648
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,000
Chinese culture. I feel it's because uh,

649
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,040
because the

650
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,280
when,

651
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:49,280
when Great Master Bodhidharma

652
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:52,000
transferred the Mahayana to China,

653
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,000
he, he really, uh, uh,

654
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,960
the Chinese Buddhism that I learned,

655
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,480
the Mahayana Buddhism I learned is

656
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,920
tremendous, it;s so profound. It's so

657
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,520
beautiful, so wonderful. And it's a gift

658
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,640
to the world, really.

659
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,599
You should

660
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,920
transcend the national barriers and, and,

661
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,800
races and genders and so forth, because

662
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,079
this Buddhism here is, to me, it's beauty.

663
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,119
It's just like you look at a piece of

664
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,320
art.

665
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,320
To me, it's like that you look at a

666
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,200
statue [unintellgible?]

667
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,720
or, or, uh, 

668
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,880

669
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,760
what's the guy who lost his ear, cut his

670
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,960
ear, to give to a prostitute girlfriend?

671
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,200
Van Gogh! Okay? Those things are just

672
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,359
beautiful. I mean look at that, like wow,

673
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,839
yeah.

674
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,839
You know, it, it, it, it

675
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,520
it makes

676
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,480
you feel good in your heart,

677
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,160
you know?

678
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,040
It's not the visual thing, it's just, you look at

679
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,599
that [and you go] "Yeah!" I mean it connects from that

680
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,560
painting to your heart directly,

681
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,000
okay?

682
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,000
Through the stomach.

683
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,040

684
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,800
But, mm, uh, so, so, I'm grateful. I don't know

685
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,480
about you, I'm so grateful that the

686
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,720
Chinese, uh,

687
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,800
Buddhism, because of what we got from them.

688
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,599
What I got from Master Xuan Hua,

689
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,160

690
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,720
is, is, it's so beautiful.

691
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,119
The first time in my life, after I learned

692
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,960
Mahayana, I said, "Wow.

693
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,560
This is

694
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,560
wonderfully

695
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,560
beautiful."

696
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,320
Okay?

697
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,079
Mahayana is,

698
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,280
helps you appreciate beauty,

699
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,359
okay?

700
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,359
Yes, was there a question somewhere? Oh, oh! Wei Mountain!

701
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,359
Speaker from Wei Mountain Temple: "Master what is the meaning behind

702
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,079
Venerable Bodhidharma

703
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,839
leaving on the leaf, because this has been

704
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,359
thousands of years, and there's a lot of

705
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:54,240
painting about it."

706
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,359
Master Yonghua: Meeting him, what?

707
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,160
Speaker from Wei Mountain Temple: "Leaving, uh, 

708
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,320
across, across the river by one piece

709
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,240
of- one leaf."

710
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,119
Master Yonghua: I have no idea,

711
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,359
okay?

712
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,760
When I'm able to do that, I will explain

713
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,760
it to you.

714
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,280
And don't hold your breath. [laughs]

715
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,200
Okay? Uh.

716
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,119
You, you Vietnamese people are weird, you know.

717
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,760
I'm just talking about the depth and the

718
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,720
beauty of Mahayana and he says, "Let's go back

719
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,040
to floating on a leaf across the river."

720
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,640
What's beautiful about that? To me, it's, it's,

721
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,440
it's Indian show-off,

722
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,200
okay?

723
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,760
We're talking about beautiful

724
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,119
Chinese people,

725
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,400
Chinese things. Okay?

726
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,280
And Taiwanese too. Yeah.

727
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,960
It's so

728
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,960
difficult nowadays, you know, to

729
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,839
not offend one

730
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,800
and, and,

731
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,040
and please the other. Anyway!

732
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,920
So, anyway, so this Sutra here, it's

733
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,960
about, it's about, uh the emphasis of this

734
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,560
Sutra here, uh, uh, is actually

735
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,520
about cultivation.

736
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,800
In order to learn about the Sudden 

737
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,680
teaching here,

738
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:11,280
you need to grind it out first, you need

739
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,280
to bear the discomfort, and

740
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,119
and keep grinding and grinding, and when

741
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,160
you ready, that's when the Sudden

742
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,280
Teaching is bestowed upon you, and boom!

743
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,640
You leap.

744
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,079
Okay? Uh,

745
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,280
any questions?

746
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,320
Okay, and, and, and uh,

747
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,960

748
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,359
this is the function, the Sudden

749
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,160
Teaching is the function of, uh,

750
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,520
the responsibility of the great teachers,

751
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,560
and um, and um,

752
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,960

753
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,800
in a way to be fair, Master Xuan Hua did

754
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,520
transmit the Sudden Teaching to his

755
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,119
disciples. But low-level

756
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,359
Sudden Teaching.

757
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,599
Alright. And, and

758
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:52,400
you pay attention to how he explained

759
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,839
the Six Patriarch Sutra, you find that

760
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,200
yes, there's some,

761
00:39:53,839 --> 00:40:00,079
some allusions to uh, the Sudden Teaching

762
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,520
when Master Xuan Hua explained it, but

763
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,000
he didn't really

764
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,800
go into greater depths. So hopefully, we

765
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,880
add more to it. This is important, because

766
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,640
remember, okay?

767
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,000
what I, we, I call American Mahayana is

768
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,400
hardly

769
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,359
by the skin color.

770
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,359
Okay? Look at us.

771
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,780
The Asians are taking over Silicon

772
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:28,400
Valley, let's face it.

773
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:30,480
[laughs]

774
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,240
Alright? Okay.

775
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,280
Oh the Koreans, they have no sense of

776
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,280
humor. They're, they're... [Sighs]

777
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,359
Ah those poor Koreans. A long way to go. Uh, um.

778
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,560
Alright.

779
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,680
So jewel,

780
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:51,680
jewel is his Dharma that is precious. 

781
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,720
Jewel is, uh, is, uh, when you hear jewel or

782
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,359
gem, uh,

783
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,200
that's of great value, it's highly

784
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:59,520
desirable, uh,

785
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,560
and it's so Chinese to me.

786
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,440
To me,

787
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,599
I would prefer for us Americans,

788
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,280
to look at the

789
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,640
beauty of

790
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,280
the Dharma. The Dharma is beautiful. The

791
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,119
Dharma, I assure you, if you

792
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,040
understand the Dharma,

793
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,720
you see the beauty.

794
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,440
What kind of beauty?

795
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,319
Uh...

796
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,319
Estée Lauder?

797
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,040
Lancôme?

798
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,880
No!

799
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,920
Beauty of

800
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,920
people's heart.

801
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,920
The heart, if you cut it up,

802
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,400
can be very beautiful,

803
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,599
when you look at it.

804
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,599
Not with the knife.

805
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:52,560
Okay? People's heart, when you get to

806
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,400
recognize, you get to see them,

807
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,200
people's heart is so beautiful. And I,

808
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,720
yesterday I was playing with a kid, a kid,

809
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,319
a naughty, naughty kid,

810
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,119
okay? And I,

811
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:07,680
it's amazing, I tell you this, you

812
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,680
know, I was playing the kid and I was

813
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,680
teaching at the same time, I was teaching

814
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,359
the kid about emotions.

815
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,560
And yesterday,

816
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:18,240
he was playing and he tripped and he fell on

817
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,599
his butt,

818
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,880
the right butt,

819
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,119
so he was, 

820
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,079
he was gathering himself up and touching

821
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,160
his butt and was deciding, "Should I

822
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:31,359
cry now, or

823
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,520
or what? [laughs] I'm entitled cry am I not?" And 

824
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,359
he was thinking I laughed at him,

825
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,880
I made fun of him, uh,

826
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,599
and he immediately got the message and

827
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,880
said, "I'm so this is so embarrassing, how

828
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,280
could I fall like this?" So he hid behind the, the,

829
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,640
he ran away and hid immediately.

830
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,680
Okay?

831
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,520

832
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,079
So, hm, so, 

833
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,520
kids' heart can be so beautiful too, you

834
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,640
know.

835
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,599
Anyway, ah,

836
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,359
so, ah,

837
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,319
the jewel here, uh,

838
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:02,560
to me, it's not, it's not the gem like a

839
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:04,720
Chinese people would like, the Asians

840
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:09,280
like to think, you know, the Indians are

841
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,839
into gold. Chinese are into jade, okay?

842
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,200
Ugh, girls are

843
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,440
into diamonds,

844
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,800
I heard.

845
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,800
And I'm into Vajra,

846
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,000
okay? Vajra is beautiful, okay? And uh, and and uh,

847
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,880

848
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,599
but primarily, you know, it's

849
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,280
the heart that interests me about this

850
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,440
Mahayana here. And

851
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,839
the heart here is uh, uh, 

852
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,720
the heart

853
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:42,720
of Mahayana, the heart of Master Huineng, in

854
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:44,800
particular, is precious, it's rare

855
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,400
and to me, it's

856
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,720
sublime.

857
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,720
Alright? Uh.

858
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,760
Platform, uh,

859
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,599
apparently on slide number 10, platform is

860
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:00,640
where the place, where the sutra is

861
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,400
spoken is Nan Hua, okay? In that famous

862
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,839
temple there,

863
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:09,040
and they build a platform like here, uh,

864
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:11,200
about 10 feet. Uh,

865
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,119
Wontec Sunim, how tall was this when you built

866
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,240
this?

867
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:20,280
You remember how tall is this?

868
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,280
Not even 31 inches. Hm.

869
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,119
Okay?

870
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:30,560
And the platform is a, is, is a place,

871
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,240
a revered place, a pure place where they did

872
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,640
important things in Buddhism. They

873
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:38,319
transmit the precept substance

874
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,079
from the heart, of Master to your heart.

875
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:42,319
That's where that happens, and then they

876
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,280
speak the Dharma to

877
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:49,400
shape the heart, okay? And that's called

878
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,400
Buddhist plastic surgery.

879
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,760
Alright? Uh,

880
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,640
seriously, they, they knew about plastic

881
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,480
surgery back then already. Ah, ah.

882
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,280
Alright 11. Mmm,

883
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,760
sutra is anything that's spoken by the

884
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,800
Buddha, uh, to teach us about cultivation

885
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,160
and um, and, uh, uh, and, and uh,

886
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,319

887
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,960

888
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:17,520
Sutra here has uh, a

889
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,480
meaning, like to attract.

890
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,599
So it's a, it's a

891
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,440

892
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,800
it's the

893
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,760
logic,

894
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,640
the, uh, 

895
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,240

896
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,119
beauty of the teaching, you know, the, the uh,

897
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,400

898
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:34,640
superior intellect, the superior wisdom

899
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,160
is very attractive to most of us.

900
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,640
And it's, and, and it's 

901
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,599
designed to give us

902
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,839
directions on how

903
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,839
to

904
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:50,319
work. The Chinese like to say to

905
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:53,040
cultivate, I don't think of cultivation.

906
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,160
I'm thinking the Sutra is teaching us how to

907
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,880
live

908
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,640
our lives to the fullest.

909
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,680
Whether you're a left-home person or a

910
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:05,119
lay perso, okay, Sutras are supposed to

911
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,640
do that, supposed to teach us how to live,

912
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,000
okay? Um,

913
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,440
be happier with

914
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,520
our lives. Okay?

915
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,319
And when you're happy,

916
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,720
you share it with your family, you

917
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,720
share it with your students, you share

918
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,040
your co-workers.

919
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,000
Okay? Uh.

920
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,960
And, uh,

921
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,920

922
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,440
in particular, this weight of

923
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,560
practice here, uh,

924
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,200
is in accord, or consistent

925
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,359
with the intent of the Buddhas and the

926
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,160
wisdom of the Buddhas.

927
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:40,720
Alright? So this Sutra here, is very

928
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,920
special because, uh, because, 

929
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,480

930
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,800
it is uh, um, it is the first time

931
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,119
in Chinese Buddhism, and I don't know if it

932
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,520
happened in Indian Buddhism or not, but

933
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,359
in Chinese Buddhism, it's the only

934
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,400
time that a Sutra

935
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,040
was, uh,

936
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,560
recorded, and the teaching was

937
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,200
recorded, and, and,

938
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:06,079
classified as a Sutra when it was spoken

939
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,000
by a

940
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,079
Chinese monk.

941
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,560
Not the Buddha. Okay?

942
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,880
So it's very, very special, it's

943
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,920
really a, a, 

944
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,760
a, uh,

945
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,760
treasure to the Chinese,

946
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,880
okay? So, we should be grateful

947
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,920
here in our era,

948
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,880
us here in this country, that we're able

949
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,280
to

950
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,040
receive this as a gift

951
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,119
from the Chinese,

952
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,599
okay? Uh,

953
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,440
you need to give credit where it's due, so

954
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,559
we need to be grateful to the

955
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,559
Chinese, uh, uh,

956
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,520
kindness

957
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:48,079
and generosity

958
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,440
via Master Xuan Hua. 

959
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,520
Okay? Uh.

960
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,440
Alright, at least I am grateful, I don't

961
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,680
know about you. Uh.

962
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,760
Okay, so when he

963
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,359
is explaining sutras, we go through the

964
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,599
Tian Tai school

965
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:04,720
for general analysis to give us an

966
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,599
overview what to expect from the Sutra,

967
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,880
so explain the names, uh

968
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,800
and uh, and uh,

969
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,400
according to that, you know,

970
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:17,920
the Tian Tai school, there's a the sutra, by the

971
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:21,200
title, it refers to a person, uh, 

972
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:24,400
and the Dharma analogy and a place and so

973
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,240
forth. Uh blah blah blah. See, you know, you can,

974
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,400
you can look it up. I'm not

975
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,480
interested in these things, uh it's too

976
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,880
Tian Tai for me. And discriminating the

977
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,400
substance, uh, it's talked about real mark

978
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,359
as substance.

979
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,400
And the real mark here is a very

980
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:42,480
advanced concept for enlightened people,

981
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,720
and this is the

982
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,880
distinctive characteristics

983
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:52,400
for Chinese Buddhism. Okay? Real mark is, is,

984
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,119
by definition, real mark is no mark,

985
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,920
but uh,

986
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,920
nothing is without mark, okay? Shi xiang wu xiang. Wu wu xiang

987
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,680
is the Chinese thing that I memorized.

988
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,559
Couldn't understand it 25 years ago.

989
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,800
Okay?

990
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,520
That's all you have to do, memorize it. So no

991
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,359
mark, but nothing without mark that is

992
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,079
real mark.

993
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:20,640
Alright? Yes yellow.

994
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,720
Speaker "Yellow": "Master, just a quick question, um,

995
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:27,040
is it possible that the Sixth Patriarch

996
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:30,520
is a reincarnation of Shakyamuni Buddha?"

997
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,520
Master Yong Hua: No! He's Vietnamese! [Audience laughs]

998
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,000
I'm glad you asked. [laughs]

999
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,920
We hear this a lot, you know, my late

1000
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,160
Vietnamese master said you know,

1001
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:47,760
I have proof, I written a book on how the

1002
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,760
Sixth Patriarch is Vietnamese.

1003
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,200
I say, "Oh,

1004
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:55,200
I know you want to leave me your temple,

1005
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:58,400
so I'm not going to disagree with you."

1006
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,079
[laughs]

1007
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,720
Uh, so,

1008
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,640

1009
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:07,200
so is he a reincarnation of the Buddha?

1010
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,599
In my, in my, humble opinion, I feel he's a

1011
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:13,119
Buddha,

1012
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:16,400
okay? Because his depth, because my teacher

1013
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:18,559
is Chinese and his level is

1014
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,800
very, very high, okay?

1015
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,800
But,

1016
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,559
when you look at his teachings, the way

1017
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,400
he taught his disciples, 

1018
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,040
and see, and he taught me

1019
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,440
three times directly, in-person and the

1020
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:37,359
other time is like, I hear, you know, I go

1021
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,359
crazy like flaming hair. [laughs]

1022
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,640
Ah yeah, there we go again. [Audience laughter]

1023
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,960
We wouldn't believe it yesterday I was

1024
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,440
taught him about five, six

1025
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,440
different emotions, he picked them just like

1026
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,440
that. [Kid fussing around in bacground]

1027
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,040
Oh no, now he has a companion.[Laughs]

1028
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,400
Alright. Ah,

1029
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,599
so, so, is he a Buddha? I feel that

1030
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,640
he's a Buddha.

1031
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,599
Because

1032
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,200
the teaching is so profound, uh,

1033
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,319
so,

1034
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,599
so

1035
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,599
beautiful, if you will. Hm.

1036
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,720
Okay?

1037
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,400
But I don't think he's Shakyayumi

1038
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,040
Buddha at all. Okay?

1039
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,079
Because that would be a bad

1040
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,599
precedent.

1041
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,760
The Buddha

1042
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,559
came, he left and he came back again? Say

1043
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,480
what?

1044
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,760
He has nothing else to do?

1045
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,000
I mean it's like,

1046
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,920
if you leave, please go, don't, don't come

1047
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,520
back. To me, it's, it's just like, doesn't make

1048
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,000
sense.

1049
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,160
There's no point being so sticky. The

1050
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,079
Buddha come and go and, and, and,

1051
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,880
let the next Buddha come.

1052
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:49,119
Give them a chance, you know. Uh, so

1053
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,960
you know, so you guys are too sticky. No, no I

1054
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,960
hope it's not Shakyamuni Buddha, but

1055
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:56,160
I don't know, because you asked me about

1056
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,440
state of a Buddha. Wrong person to ask.

1057
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,520
Okay? Uh.

1058
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,920
Ask something I know, not something I

1059
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,920
don't know. Uh.

1060
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,760
Okay, what is the principle here?

1061
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,960
M'kay?

1062
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,119

1063
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,160
To become a Buddha.

1064
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,119
All of us can become a Buddha.

1065
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,559
Okay?

1066
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,839
Message:

1067
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,440
don't

1068
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:23,760
sell yourself short. 

1069
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,480
It [?] knows discrimination, okay? Uh.

1070
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,319
So,, uh, uh, it's, it's a, 

1071
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,920

1072
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,559

1073
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,079
anyone can become a Buddha. That's why, uh,

1074
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,280
that's why, uh,

1075
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,480
that's why, now is our chance, okay, we

1076
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,440
don't have to uh,

1077
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,800
go to China anymore. Although,

1078
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,800
you know,

1079
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,880
you want to learn Tai Chi, I still feel

1080
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,599
we need still need to go to China. Wu

1081
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,240
Dang, okay. [?]

1082
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:53,119
I will go to Wu Dang [?] for about a year or two,

1083
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,119
I would love to go there and learn.

1084
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:58,000
You know, I hear,

1085
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,240
speaking of walking on leaves, I hear they

1086
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,119
walk on walls.

1087
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:06,160
I saw a demonstration. Shhh.

1088
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:09,920
He actually walked on walls. 

1089
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,920
I was so impressed, I said, "Wow."

1090
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,680
Anyway, uh,

1091
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:19,280
so you can realize, realize

1092
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,400
Buddhahood. You can. All of us can.

1093
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,160
Okay?

1094
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,800
No one is exempt. Even the lady back there

1095
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,559
who's half-asleep,. She can too. The

1096
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,520
Sudden Teaching is that, we can all

1097
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:33,359
become a Buddha, just like that.

1098
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,359
But she must have to cross her legs. [laughs]

1099
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,720
Just kidding. [laughs]

1100
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,400
There's a requirement, you think it's free?

1101
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:44,800
No, we all have to work for it. And the

1102
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,119
function is to understand the mind and

1103
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,040
see your own nature. Here,

1104
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,040
understanding the mind

1105
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:54,559
is very interesting.

1106
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:56,400
You get to see how mind works. Your mind.

1107
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,880
How your mind works. And once you

1108
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,800
understand how your mind works, you begin

1109
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,880
to be able to see how

1110
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,720
In's [?] mind

1111
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,119
work.

1112
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,119
You see? Uh.

1113
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,760
Alright? Hm.

1114
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:14,800
And the teaching mark is, uh, uh,

1115
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,559
oh god, this is so scholarly.

1116
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,119
Sutra is like sweet dew,

1117
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:21,599
heavenly elixir of immortality.

1118
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:23,599
Uh yeah, so Chinese, uh,

1119
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,400
I don't like these concepts because it

1120
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,400
makes you greedy.

1121
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:34,079
You know, uh,

1122
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:38,000
it like, makes you so special. "I'm

1123
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:40,880
listening to Sixth Patriarch Sutra." Uh.

1124
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,599
Hello Mama [laughs]

1125
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,599
from China.

1126
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:49,440
[Laughs] Uh,

1127
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:53,319
I'm glad you made it! The last time I saw

1128
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,319
you in Wei Mountain temple.

1129
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,739
Oh, okay. Xie xie, bu ke qi. [laughs]

1130
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,440
Ah.

1131
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:08,720
So, ah, so, um, this um, this um, 

1132
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,599
not only is it beautiful,

1133
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,520
but

1134
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,760
it's very tasty.

1135
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,079
You, you can taste, you know,

1136
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,599
that has to be real. When you

1137
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,680
listen to the Sutra,

1138
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,520
and so every now and then you might get

1139
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,240
to the state, where actually when you

1140
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,400
swallow your saliva, it's kind of sweet.

1141
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,760
That's a sweet dew right there.

1142
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,119
It happens.

1143
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,720
Alright? Hm.

1144
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,160

1145
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,079
And, and uh, 

1146
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:38,960
teaching period is, is uh, is uh, this uh,

1147
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,880
happened during the Dharma uh, Flower

1148
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,040
and Lotus-Nirvana period 

1149
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,920
and so forth,

1150
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,319
okay?

1151
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,960
Alright, any questions?

1152
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:51,280
I'm not, as you have noticed by now, I'm

1153
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,880
not interested in scholarly things. I'm

1154
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,960
just like,

1155
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,280
this raw

1156
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,839

1157
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,839
and uh, and uh, uh, uh, 

1158
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,960
limited person. I'm more interested in

1159
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,160
something that, that's, uh, 

1160
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,240
beautiful,

1161
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,920
tasty and that kind of thing, you will

1162
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,400
have my interest. Uh.

1163
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,720
But scholarly things, I leave it to the

1164
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,280
PHD people.

1165
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,680
Alright. Um.

1166
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:23,520
Five Chinese Pariarchs. Okay? Now you should be, you 

1167
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:27,200
should know about, okay. Uh.

1168
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:29,359
That's how uh, Chinese Buddhism, uh,

1169
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,599
started to take root in China. This is

1170
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:34,160
important because we need to know

1171
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,920
for our generation, how are we going to

1172
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,400
make these

1173
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,799
American Mahayana take root.

1174
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,040
Okay? We are, right now I'm in my second

1175
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,720
generation, you're the third generation, so

1176
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,760
therefore, it

1177
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:49,440
helps to go back to how it happened in

1178
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,599
China, okay?

1179
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,599
Because we learned from the Chinese anyway. Okay, hm, hm.

1180
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,559
And,

1181
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:03,520
so it's uh, it's set from the uh, uh,

1182
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:07,680
Song of Enlightenment, another famous Chinese uh

1183
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:08,720
creation by the Seventh Patrairch. Uh, uh, that uh,

1184
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,359

1185
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,520
he recognized Bodhidharma who was the 28th

1186
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:17,280
Patriarch, okay. In that

1187
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:19,040
proper or orthodox line of Mahayana

1188
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,359
Buddhism, okay?

1189
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,160

1190
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:24,559
And, uh, and, uh,

1191
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:28,640
all the Indian

1192
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:30,160
prior Patriarchs from 1 to 27, followed

1193
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,440
Bodhidharma's, to, 

1194
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,680

1195
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,640
he brought all that

1196
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,000
Indian

1197
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:39,200
heritage

1198
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,920
from India to China.

1199
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:46,319
And conferred upon the Chinese. So the

1200
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:48,799
Chinese inherited all that Indian wisdom,

1201
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:50,720
okay? And that's what is meant by

1202
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:53,520
transmitting, uh,

1203
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,520
the wisdom from India to China, okay? It

1204
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:58,319
became Chinese.

1205
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:00,880
The Chinese became the guardian

1206
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,599
of the Indian wisdom.

1207
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,640
And, and, 

1208
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,920

1209
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:08,079
and later on after Sixth Pariarch, the Chinese

1210
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,599
Buddhism later on, really really

1211
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:13,359
prospered and blossomed. They produced, uh,

1212
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:16,000
many great talents,

1213
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:20,000
many great patriarchs, uh,

1214
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,599
that I feel that for us, in our era, our

1215
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,520
times, uh,

1216
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,720
we should spend the time to learn

1217
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,240
Chinese

1218
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,960
and study

1219
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:31,359
these great Chinese teachers.

1220
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,680
Because the depth of Mahayana, I keep on

1221
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:36,720
telling you this, is in the Chinese

1222
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:40,160
language, not in English yet.

1223
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:43,440
Okay? So if you want Mahayana wisdom, uh,

1224
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:45,599
deeper wisdom, higher level wisdom, you have

1225
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,920
to learn Chinese.

1226
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,920
Okay?

1227
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Any questions about that? So you know

1228
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,640
where to find, look for materials, and

1229
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,559
where to look, where to look for in terms

1230
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,680
of great teachers.

1231
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,640
It's not,

1232
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:03,760
you know, the, uh, Chinese

1233
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:06,799
teachings, Patriarch teachings actually

1234
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:09,119
much higher level than

1235
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:09,119
here,

1236
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,280
that's available in English.

1237
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,680
That's a fact.

1238
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,880
Okay? So for you, those of you out there

1239
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:21,040
who feel that you understand Mahayana, I

1240
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,799
strongly urge you to learn Chinese.

1241
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:26,640
Because you should go back to the

1242
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:29,040
Chinese teachers, okay? And

1243
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,200
in the future, I hope you transfer,

1244
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,880
translate that teaching from Chinese

1245
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,880
into English.

1246
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,000
Okay? In order to do that,

1247
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,520
you have

1248
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,680
to learn Chan.

1249
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,040
Chan is a requirement.

1250
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,920
Okay?

1251
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:47,280
Without Chan, you cannot have the proper

1252
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:50,160
translation, and you find in the Sutra,

1253
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:53,200
that we use an old version of um,

1254
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,640
my Master's disciples' translation, and it

1255
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,280
has

1256
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:00,880
quite a few things

1257
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,640
that missed the mark completely.

1258
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,520
Okay, uh, 

1259
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:08,000
and so there are some

1260
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,520
significant Patriarchs,

1261
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,559
Mahakashyapa, uh,

1262
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:14,559
don't have much teaching of him, Ananda

1263
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:19,200
and then the Second Patriarch, the Fourteenth

1264
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:19,200
Patriarch, very famous. They were Nagarjuna.

1265
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:26,280
Nagarjuna?

1266
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,280
How do you say it, huh, flaming hair?

1267
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,240
How?

1268
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,440
Speaker Flaming hair: "Master I don't know, but

1269
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,480
um, Na-, Naga-,

1270
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,280

1271
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,369
Nagarjuna?"

1272
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,369
Master Yonghua: Oh no. Speaker Flaiming Hair: "I don't know." Master Yong Hua: Nevermind. Stay there. Don't uh- 

1273
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,720
Okay, and

1274
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:00,480
then, Naga-, Nagar-

1275
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:04,000
Nagarjuna, and then Vasubandu is another famous, uh, uh,

1276
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,680
famous Indian Patriarch.

1277
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,280
Next, 15. Uh, uh,

1278
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,640

1279
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,640
Bodhidharma,

1280
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:14,400
we're talking about Bodidharma, he is a

1281
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:16,559
prince in of a kingdom in Southern India.

1282
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,760
King was a very devout Buddhist. It shows

1283
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,000
right there.

1284
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,000
If

1285
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:26,480
your

1286
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,480
parents are Buddhists,

1287
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:33,760
then you're bestowing

1288
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,760
great blessings to your children,

1289
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,599
because you give them exposure

1290
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,880
to

1291
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,880
the teaching of wisdom.

1292
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,440
Okay?

1293
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,400
Uh, so,

1294
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:51,680
so the conventional wisdom is that, is that,

1295
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:53,040
when you're born into a family as

1296
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,480
Buddhist, uh,

1297
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,319
you are

1298
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,440
incredibly, uh,

1299
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:00,000
blessed,

1300
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:02,160
if you will.

1301
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,160
Alright?

1302
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,119
Uh, hm, of course they are always exceptions.

1303
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,440
Uh, but not only was the king was a

1304
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:19,039
Buddhist, he is a devout Buddhist,

1305
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,799
and uh, and uh, 

1306
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,760
he made, uh, 

1307
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:23,520

1308
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,240
offerings to

1309
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:30,400
the Patriarch. So he have access to the

1310
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:34,480
27th Patriarch, okay? And he

1311
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:36,400
gave a priceless pearl to the Patriarch,

1312
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,000
okay? Uh.

1313
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,200
Lesson number two

1314
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,720
You have

1315
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,799
to make offerings

1316
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,880
to the Patriarchs,

1317
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:47,680
to the great teachers,

1318
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,760
okay? So this king here, not only was he

1319
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,920
devout, devoted to, uh,

1320
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,400
Buddhism, meaning that he helped propagate

1321
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:57,520
Buddhism, he also made

1322
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:00,400
a lot of offerings, supported the

1323
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,280
great teachers, the Patriarchs.

1324
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,520
Okay?

1325
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,599
And,

1326
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,200
because of that

1327
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:10,640
his children

1328
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,640
have tremendous blessings,

1329
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:18,079
okay? And so this is very special family.

1330
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:22,559
So when he offered a priceless pearl to the

1331
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:24,480
27th Indian Patriarch, he showed the pearl, the Patriarch showed the pearl 

1332
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:28,079
to the

1333
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:30,799
three princes, sons of the King and asked

1334
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:33,680
"Anything more valuable than this pearl, uh,

1335
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:34,559
that I just received?"

1336
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,839
And

1337
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:40,640
the, the two older princes said

1338
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:43,200
"Pearl is the most precious

1339
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:45,760
in our kingdom, and there's nothing

1340
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,039
better in the world." Very proud of it.

1341
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,640
16.

1342
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,280
The third prince,

1343
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:54,240
the youngest one, was Bodhidharma, who

1344
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:57,039
later became Bodhidharma said, "This 

1345
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,039
worldly pearl, uh, uh,

1346
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,200
is not the most precious thing. Uh.

1347
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,799
It is uh,

1348
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,520

1349
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:07,599
among all the, uh,

1350
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:10,319
gems in the world, uh,

1351
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,319
the truth

1352
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,440
is the supreme jewel."

1353
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:15,440
Okay? Uh.

1354
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,520
So Indian.

1355
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,559
Okay?

1356
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:25,680
But, uh,

1357
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:28,720
but back then as a young prince, he had,

1358
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:32,400
he valued the truth already. Okay?

1359
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,520
He felt the truth was a treasure,

1360
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,720
that

1361
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,240
uh, that

1362
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,920
that you, that uh, 

1363
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,880
should be cherished,

1364
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,240
not, not, uh,

1365
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:46,559
not gems and jewels.

1366
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,559
And the prince, uh, uh,

1367
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:50,319
continues. He says,

1368
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,720

1369
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:54,160
"This worldly luster, uh,

1370
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,559
cannot be

1371
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,359
considered the finest. Okay?

1372
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,960
The

1373
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:01,520
light, the,

1374
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:07,720
the brightness, the light, that's most

1375
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:07,720
precious is uh, from the light of wisdom.

1376
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,839
Hm.

1377
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:16,559
And uh, the pearl, even though, uh, has

1378
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:20,240
lucidity, uh, uh,

1379
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:22,880
but the lucidity of the mind is uh,

1380
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:27,200
is the most desirable." Okay?

1381
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:31,440
So, uh, the young prince's, uh, uh

1382
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:32,480
answer is really outstanding.

1383
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,680
And so, so the,

1384
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,559

1385
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:40,160
it showed that this, this young man here

1386
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:42,319
had potential to be taught, okay?

1387
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:45,760
And that's what great teachers

1388
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:47,839
recognize. They recognize people, they say,

1389
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:52,880
"Who can be taught?

1390
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:52,880
Who would be worthy of my efforts?"

1391
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:59,119
Yes go ahead, yellow.

1392
01:05:56,319 --> 01:06:03,280
Speaker Yellow: "Ah, Master, regarding the pronunciation of

1393
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:06,880
Nagarjuna, Anthony heard from a disciple, uh,

1394
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,880
it's pronounced Nagarjuna." Master Yonghua: Nagarjuna?

1395
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,960
Speaker Yellow: "Yes, yes, that's what I heard from one of your

1396
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:13,599
disciples, I think." Master Yonghua: "Yeah yeah, I remember

1397
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,200
vaguely, I just cannot remember which uh, which uh, uh, uh, which

1398
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:18,799

1399
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:21,280
syllable to put the inflection on.

1400
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:23,520
So i thought it was from flaming hair,

1401
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,200
but it's not, it's from someone else. Speaker: "Yeah.

1402
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,119
I think it's from someone else." Master Yong Hua: Yeah,

1403
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:31,160
someone else. It's clearly not flaming

1404
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,160
hair, flaming hair is still

1405
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,960
uh- Alright, um,

1406
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,920
and uh, uh, and uh, and uh,

1407
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:42,559

1408
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,680
Bodhidharma said a lot of things,

1409
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:46,400
that you know,

1410
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:49,280
Indians. They're, they're  wordy, and 

1411
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,280
they, they talk too much. Uh, uh.

1412
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:57,760
You know, from a Chan perspective,

1413
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:58,799
if I were the 27th Patriarch, which I'm

1414
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,920
not,

1415
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:03,839
I'd say, "You talk too much boy."

1416
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,880
Uh, uh, 

1417
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:06,319

1418
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,720
So but anyway,

1419
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:12,240
clearly, this young prince

1420
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:15,359
here, has a special mind. He's, he's not

1421
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:16,960
impressed by worldly things.

1422
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:18,480
Okay?

1423
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,280
And it comes with, it comes with

1424
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,720
prior blessings. If you

1425
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:25,359
will.

1426
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,799
If your children have blessings, they'd be

1427
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:28,799
drawn

1428
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:31,599
to

1429
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:32,960
things of wisdom,

1430
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:35,119
okay?

1431
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:38,319
Instead of, they will not be impressed by

1432
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:38,319
the size of the temple. [Audience laughs]

1433
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,280
If I could influence you a little bit, [laughs]

1434
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:51,280
we're not like uh, the kings who has

1435
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:52,559
palaces and three princes and so forth.

1436
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,079
You know, and,

1437
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:57,839
and so forth.

1438
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,839
What we have is big hearts.

1439
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:04,720
Okay. So, uh,

1440
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,119
I'm not interested in what the young

1441
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,960
Bodhidharma had to say to his teacher.

1442
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:11,760
He's not enlightened back then, so it's a

1443
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,920
lot of nonsense. Okay? But somehow the

1444
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,318
Indians were impressed, the Chinese were

1445
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:20,560
impressed, so they, they put this

1446
01:08:16,318 --> 01:08:23,600
down. Okay, to me it's too wordy. It's

1447
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:27,520
too many words, okay? It's not Chan-like.

1448
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:29,359
And later, he became better, okay?

1449
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,278
Uh, so after the

1450
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:34,480
King father's death, uh,

1451
01:08:31,278 --> 01:08:35,679
the young prince became disciple,

1452
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,520
and, uh, and uh, 

1453
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:42,000

1454
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:44,480
and became a monk, okay? So, you see, uh,

1455
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,758
right there again, the behavior

1456
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:47,838
this person

1457
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:51,199
is similar to the Buddha's, Shak-

1458
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:53,199
Gautama Buddha's, where he, uh,

1459
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:55,600
was not

1460
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:57,120
impressed by worldly things,

1461
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,080
by luxury,

1462
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,880
by

1463
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:03,120
the, uh, the

1464
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:06,080
worldly pleasures, okay? He,

1465
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,080
he, uh, he uh, he

1466
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,880
followed his teacher,

1467
01:09:11,278 --> 01:09:14,560
and

1468
01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:16,000
he served his teacher for 40 years until 

1469
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,838
he died.

1470
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,199
Okay?

1471
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:20,560

1472
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:23,359
Another, another, another,

1473
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,480
fact about Great Bodhidharma is that he

1474
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,318

1475
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:28,000
serves his teacher,

1476
01:09:26,318 --> 01:09:29,040
okay? Ah, and, and uh,

1477
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,238

1478
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:33,278

1479
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:34,798
and that's one of the most beautiful

1480
01:09:33,278 --> 01:09:36,000
things you can do

1481
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:37,278
to show

1482
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,318
gratitude.

1483
01:09:37,278 --> 01:09:44,400
He showed- the reason, he's a prince

1484
01:09:40,318 --> 01:09:46,480
remember, he's used to being, uh,

1485
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,520
treated like uh,

1486
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:50,400
the, uh, the

1487
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,960
potential future King, future Emperor,

1488
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:55,760
therefore he's supposed to be uh,

1489
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:58,480
idolized and so forth, but no. He revered

1490
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,719
his teacher and became a monk to serve

1491
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,719
him, um, uh, uh,

1492
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,600
for 40 years. That's very, very impressive,

1493
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,280
okay?

1494
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,280
And to me, there is no, uh,

1495
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,280
higher

1496
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:18,400
way, better way to express gratitude by

1497
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:21,199
taking care of your teacher, okay?

1498
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:22,239
Of a, of a great teacher like him.

1499
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:23,760

1500
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:26,239
And, and uh,

1501
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,040
and that's one thing there that you can

1502
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:30,800
learn

1503
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:31,679
to spot children or people, okay?

1504
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,760

1505
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:38,719
The common denominator of these great

1506
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,719
people is that they know gratitude.

1507
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:48,159
It comes from the heart. If your heart is

1508
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:51,040
big, your heart is full of gratitude.

1509
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:52,080
You don't always have to take,

1510
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,800
okay?

1511
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,800
You can give,

1512
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:01,520
okay? You give back to the people

1513
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,520
that

1514
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:05,600
did you great favors. Hm?

1515
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:12,640
Like your teacher, like your parents, like

1516
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,760
your ancestors and so forth,

1517
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:17,440
okay? Uh.

1518
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:19,920
That's what's uh, what special

1519
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,960
about the Asian culture,

1520
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,280
okay? Uh.

1521
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:26,239
You teach gratitude,

1522
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:28,719
by being grateful, not, not by talking

1523
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:31,600
about it,

1524
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:33,360
okay? And so Bodhidharma served his

1525
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:37,280
master for 40 years, that's very

1526
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:38,640
impressive, okay? Until his master died

1527
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:41,679
and, and

1528
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:43,600
his master, uh,

1529
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:44,400
asked him

1530
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,080
to

1531
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,040
go to China

1532
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,840
to

1533
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,760
uh,

1534
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:53,120
bring Mahayana from India to China. So

1535
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,920
basically, uh,

1536
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:57,600
named him as the 28th Patriarch,

1537
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,440
okay? Hm.

1538
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,800
And when he came there, uh,

1539
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,239
didn't speak

1540
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,960
Chinese at all.

1541
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:04,320
So

1542
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,000
the Chinese

1543
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,239
were very, uh,

1544
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,159
discriminatory and look at him and say,

1545
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:12,960
"Your skin is too black

1546
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:16,159
and you're too- your beard, you have a huge

1547
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:19,280
beard," and you know,

1548
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:22,480
so they looked down upon this. They're scornful, uh,

1549
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,440
towards Venerable Bodhidharma,

1550
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,679
okay?

1551
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:27,040
Uh.

1552
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:28,159
Don't know why

1553
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:31,360
the

1554
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:34,480
Chinese would draw Bodhidharma bare-

1555
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:36,640
chested, with a lot of hair.

1556
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,920
Do Indians have a lot of hair or not?

1557
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,920
Chest hair?

1558
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,199
They do?

1559
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:44,000
I

1560
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:44,000
never know that.

1561
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,840
Watch the movies?

1562
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:51,679
[Laughter]

1563
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:55,120
Not! We're not watching the same movies!

1564
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:55,120
Is there a lot of dancing like [Master Yonghua mimics Bollywood music and dancing] [audience laughter]

1565
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,800
I know- you, you, they're talking all of a

1566
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:05,800
sudden, the man breaks out into dance and

1567
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,800
sings? [Master Yonghua mimics Bollywood music and dance] [Audience laughs] [Master Yong Hua laughs]

1568
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,640
Anyway, hairy chest. Uh.

1569
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,199
Why?

1570
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,880
Why you would draw

1571
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,840
him like that?

1572
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,480
Anyway.

1573
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:29,120
And then, 21.

1574
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:32,080
He uh, he met with emperor, the emperor of the

1575
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:35,040
Liang dynasty, Emperor Wu. This is a very

1576
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:37,520
famous interchange, okay? Hey, it's funny

1577
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:39,120
how children, there's so many children here today

1578
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,120
who are listening about these words of

1579
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,600
wisdom and they have no clue what we're

1580
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:47,040
talking about.

1581
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:49,360
[Master Yong Hua laughs]

1582
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,960
It's fantastic. Ah.

1583
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,640
It's called brainwashing, you know that?

1584
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,880
It's called Buddhist brainwashing. You

1585
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,480
bring them here, and you put on- you can do

1586
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,440
the same thing at home, by the way. Turn

1587
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,199
on the,

1588
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:01,280
the, the tapes and, and you let them

1589
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:03,199
play, while they listen to all this thing

1590
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,920
we talk about. It's called

1591
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:08,239
brainwashing.

1592
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:11,920
In the future, they become, they become, you

1593
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:14,480
know a monk, and with

1594
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:17,360
the Patriarch as well. 

1595
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:19,920
So Emperor Wu, 

1596
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:21,120
who is, uh, uh, who prided himself on, on being

1597
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,960

1598
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:25,040
knowledge about Buddhism.

1599
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,600
He spoke to him through an

1600
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,880
interpreter, of course.

1601
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:32,159
And, um,

1602
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:34,159
who is that interpreter is probably, in

1603
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:37,440
my humble opinion, in my

1604
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:40,000
opinion, he's that interpreter, probably an

1605
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:43,600
ancestor, of our, of our

1606
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,600
precious Zhi Hong.

1607
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:51,120
Oh, you don't know Zhi Hong, it doesn't

1608
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:54,000
matter, okay. So Emperor Wu says,

1609
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:57,440
"Ah, in my entire life I helped a lot of

1610
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,280
monks and nuns uh, become monks and nuns,"

1611
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:01,760
because when you become monks and nuns you need

1612
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:04,400
to have clothing, proper clothing. So he

1613
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:07,199
paid for the clothing, for the bowls, for

1614
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:09,760
the shoes and so forth, okay?

1615
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:12,400
And he built monasteries for them. So

1616
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:15,600
he said, "I've done all those and

1617
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:19,120
have a lot of Sutras copied, okay? 

1618
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:20,159
And uh, created a lot of Buddha images, okay.

1619
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,520

1620
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:25,840

1621
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:28,480
And how, how much merit did I earn?" Okay

1622
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,480
Bodhidharma says, "None."

1623
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,840
And, and uh,

1624
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:35,360
says, "Good deeds done with 

1625
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,760
greed,

1626
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:40,800
worldly intent," okay,

1627
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,840
I would translate it as greed,

1628
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:46,000
okay?

1629
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:46,000
He did all those to impress people.

1630
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,120
Okay? When you do good deeds to impress

1631
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,560
others, it's,

1632
01:15:53,120 --> 01:16:00,080
it's called worldly intent, is

1633
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:03,360
self-serving, in other words, okay?

1634
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:04,719
And so you're greedy for recognition

1635
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:07,679
in other words.

1636
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:09,199
You're greedy for rewards, okay? Uh.

1637
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:10,400
That's the wrong way

1638
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,920
to do

1639
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:15,920
good deeds.

1640
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,920
You should do good deeds because

1641
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:21,360
because, 

1642
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:23,440
there's a chance to do it.

1643
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:25,600
That's all. When we have the chance to do

1644
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:27,600
something good, just do it and then

1645
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,080
forget it.

1646
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,920
Okay? Uh. That's all.

1647
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:34,719
And, and uh,

1648
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,560
so Bodhidharma said, "You did a

1649
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:38,560
good deed,

1650
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,080
you bring good karma, uh,

1651
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:44,000
but no merit."

1652
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:44,000
Okay? And the Emperor uh, uh,

1653
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:49,199
then pursued. He says,

1654
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:51,360
"What is the highest meaning?" So he, he

1655
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:52,640
didn't like it, so he changed the topic,

1656
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:55,520
you see?

1657
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,679
Emperor's most convenient, but actually

1658
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:01,280
after he heard the first answer, he says

1659
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:04,239
"No merit whatsoever," he says,

1660
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:06,480
"You just lost an ear, boy," I mean Indian

1661
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:06,480
guy! [Master Yonghua laughs]

1662
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,280
So he said, "Okay, but I'm going to be

1663
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:11,360
civil,

1664
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:13,520
he's a Patriarch, supposedly.

1665
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:16,800
So, I can be, I'm an emperor, so I need to

1666
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:19,600
show my civil side." So he said, he changed

1667
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:21,679
the subject, and said. What he- He said,

1668
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,199
"What is the highest meaning of the noble

1669
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:26,400
truth?"

1670
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:27,920
Okay? See? He's very well-read. Bodhidharma

1671
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:31,440
says, "There's no, no, no

1672
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:33,520
noble truth. There's only

1673
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,719
emptiness."

1674
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,920
Okay?

1675
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,920
Bodhidharma actually by then, was a little bit, uh, uh,

1676
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:43,679
cautious because he could tell that uh,

1677
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:45,440
the emperor was not happy with him, and

1678
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:48,080
there's no point in offending him evem

1679
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:50,239
more than he needs to, needed to. So he

1680
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:52,320
said, "There's no more truth, there's only

1681
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:53,760
emptiness." Actually

1682
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,679
he could have said from a Chan

1683
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,199
perspective, uh,

1684
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:59,840
what is the highest meaning of noble

1685
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:59,840
truth? Uh. Uh.

1686
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,560
He could have said, uh,

1687
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:07,120
nothing.

1688
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:09,600
But no, he said, "There's no noble truth,

1689
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:12,320
there's only emptiness." So you can tell

1690
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:14,080
he's scared.

1691
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,679
23.

1692
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:18,880
And then the emperor

1693
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:20,000
again was stumped. He said, "I can't pursue

1694
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,960
this, so

1695
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:26,239
let's give him another, uh, one last chance

1696
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,120
Who's standing before me?"

1697
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:30,000
Okay?

1698
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:31,199
Meaning zhèn, zhèn is Chinese for "I'm

1699
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,920
better than you."

1700
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:35,280
You see? He says, "I'm better than you.

1701
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,800
I'm, I'm

1702
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,800
nobility, and you are uh, 

1703
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:42,480
black. Um,

1704
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:48,640
dark-skinned I mean." Uh.

1705
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:52,000
And Bodhidharma says, "I know not Your

1706
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:52,000
Majesty," okay? You know, 

1707
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:56,480
"I know not"- hmm,

1708
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:58,960

1709
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,400
The proper translation should be, change it

1710
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,600
to, "I

1711
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,600
cannot tell."

1712
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:11,040
Master Xian Jie, don't just sit there, do something.

1713
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:19,600
"I cannot tell." You see? The, the

1714
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:20,960
immediate answer is so beautiful.

1715
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,880
He says,

1716
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:25,760

1717
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,760
uh, I say, he says, "Duì zhèn zhě shuí." Um.

1718
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:34,719
Who's in front of me?

1719
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:37,280
Can you try, change it please?

1720
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:38,800
"Who's in front of me?"

1721
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,760

1722
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,719
Okay?

1723
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,719
"Who's facing me?"

1724
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,520
Either one.

1725
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:51,239
Okay?

1726
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:04,600
And so the, the brutal answer from, from,

1727
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:04,600
Bodhidharma, he meant in english is,

1728
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,719
"I can't tell."

1729
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,679
Alright? Uh.

1730
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:26,719
So, and

1731
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:28,639
after that, the emperor gave up

1732
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:31,199
and uh, he said uh, uh,

1733
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:33,840
"Excuse me, I need to go take this

1734
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,840
phone call here. Uh.

1735
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,840
From Russia." 

1736
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,560
And uh,

1737
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:46,480
so later, he had an advisor.

1738
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:49,280
Would you believe it's Zhi Gong?

1739
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:51,760
Zhi Gong is one of the, of the

1740
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:54,239
wisest Chinese monks, and what does he do

1741
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,320
advising this kind of emperor? Oh my

1742
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:57,199
goodness!

1743
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,840
I, I, I,

1744
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:02,960
when I got to this point here, I lost all

1745
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,960
respect for Zhi Gong.

1746
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:09,040
Because if you hang around this person,

1747
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:11,679
who was thirsty for power, recognition,

1748
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:15,280
greedy, he was so greedy,

1749
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:16,480
okay? The only way that you can

1750
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:19,440
help,

1751
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:19,440
is yourself.

1752
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:27,199
Because that's how he sees you.

1753
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:30,000
Okay? If Zhi Gong is a true Patriarch,

1754
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:32,400
a great, a person of great wisdom, he'd say, "I'm

1755
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,719
sorry, young master, okay, I'm not worthy of

1756
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,600
your patronage."

1757
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:40,560
Here's,

1758
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:40,560
uh, the master at the DRBA, go over there.

1759
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:46,800
Okay? Yeah so, uh, I, I,

1760
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:48,800
it's a personal thing for me because

1761
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,320
I know I was growing up, I mean when I

1762
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,560
was learning the Way, uh,

1763
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:54,719
Master Xuan Hua

1764
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:57,120
spoke so highly of Master Zhi Gong. He

1765
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:59,600
had spiritual powers and so forth. When

1766
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:01,760
I got to this point here, I said

1767
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:06,080
"What are you doing, advising this emperor?"

1768
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:06,080
So he's this way because you advised him?

1769
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:12,080
So he's your creation. He's a product of

1770
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:15,920
your training, right?

1771
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:18,719
So, I would run, uh, okay? That's why Zhi Gong

1772
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:20,800
is, you know, out. Uh, uh.

1773
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:22,159
So Zhi Gong says,

1774
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:26,320
"Your Highness, uh,

1775
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:26,320
still don't recognize this person?" Bì xià hái shí cǐ rén fǒu?

1776
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,920
Hm. So you don't recognize this person, okay?

1777
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,960
And the emperor says, "Uh, uh,

1778
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,440
I don't."

1779
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:47,360
And Zhi Gong says, "This is Guan Yin

1780
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:47,360
transmitting the Buddha's Mind Seal."

1781
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:55,520
Okay?

1782
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:58,080
So Zhi Gong says Bodhidharma actually is, is

1783
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,080
Guan Yin.

1784
01:22:58,670 --> 01:23:05,040

1785
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:05,040
So clearly, Guan Yin has nothing else to do.

1786
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:11,920
But we, we have so many Bodhisattvas,

1787
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:14,239
and Guan Yin says, "Let me bring

1788
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:16,239
Mahayana from India to China. You, the rest of

1789
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:17,600
you can go on vacation, go to the Bahamas,

1790
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:19,760
or you, uh,

1791
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,679
take a hike, and you know, or something.

1792
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:24,800
Let me do it for you."

1793
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:24,800
So the rest of the Bodhisattvas say, [Master Yonghua makes bewildered expression]

1794
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,280
"So we don't get a chance to create

1795
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:30,719
blessings for ourselves?"

1796
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,840
Okay? So,

1797
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:36,639
I don't know about this Zhi Gong guy

1798
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:40,159
here. Okay? Yeah, with all due respect to the

1799
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:40,159
Chinese and Taiwanese people.

1800
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:50,800
And um, and so the emperor heard that

1801
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:53,199
this is a Sage, so he was uh, he, he, uh, he

1802
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,159
had second thoughts and tried to, uh,

1803
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:55,120

1804
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:56,320
send

1805
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:59,440
his, uh, uh,

1806
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:01,760
boy to ask the

1807
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,199
Venerable Bodhidharma to backtrack

1808
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:06,639
and come back so that he can make

1809
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:06,639
offerings and support him.

1810
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,159
Uh, uh, and

1811
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:13,490
Zhi Gong says, uh,

1812
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:14,840
"No, don't bother. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

1813
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:18,239

1814
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:19,840
Even if,

1815
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:22,800
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

1816
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:24,080
even if the entire nation

1817
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,880
goes,

1818
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:28,639
all our people go, okay,

1819
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,520
he 

1820
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:32,239
still

1821
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,239
wouldn't come back." Hm.

1822
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:36,960
Okay? Uh.

1823
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:39,360
So he says, uh, uh,

1824
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:43,120
gai guó rén qù

1825
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:43,120
And he says, "Even if

1826
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:47,520
we all go,

1827
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,520
okay?

1828
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:55,040
He still would not, will not come back.

1829
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,480
Not return. Would not come back." Alright?

1830
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,880
And so,

1831
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,710
this is a story of a transmission

1832
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,000
from India, uh, 

1833
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:05,040
Mahayana,

1834
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,159
from India to China. So Venerable Bodhidharma went to

1835
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,320
Nan Jing,

1836
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:11,520
listen Dharma Shen Kuang, um,

1837
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:14,080
speak Dharma. And back then it'ss typical, as

1838
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:16,400
typical as it is nowadays, people speak

1839
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:18,400
Dharma without

1840
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:21,040
wisdom.

1841
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,080
They spoke words.

1842
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,840
They didn't,

1843
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:26,000
they didn't

1844
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,440
teach, uh,

1845
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,880
from the wisdom,

1846
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:31,440
but from

1847
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:32,320
regurgitating

1848
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,480
the, uh, the, uh, 

1849
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:37,600
the technical jargon. Uh.

1850
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:40,639
But even doing, even for uh,

1851
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:42,400
just doing so, the heavens rain

1852
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:46,159
fragrant blossoms

1853
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:46,960
and golden-petaled lotus rose from earth.

1854
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:49,679
Okay.

1855
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:51,280
And so he's uh, he's uh, an

1856
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:52,639
extraordinary

1857
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,320
Dharma Master,

1858
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:56,480
to the point where the heaven lands were

1859
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:59,679
making offerings to him.

1860
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:01,679
And so Bodhidharma stopped by, listened

1861
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:05,120
to his lecture,

1862
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:05,920
and waited for everyone to leave,

1863
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,840
and

1864
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:10,320
cornered

1865
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,520
down Master Shen Kuan, and asked

1866
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,960
him,

1867
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,120
"What, uh, what 

1868
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:18,880
are you doing?" And Shen Kuang says, "I am

1869
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:18,880
explaining Sutras. Can't you tell?" Uh.

1870
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:24,880
And he said, uh,

1871
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,080
"Why are you explaining the Sutras?" He

1872
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:29,120
said, uh,

1873
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:30,719
"The answer is, uh, to teach people to end

1874
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,880
birth and death."

1875
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:34,560
And Bodhidharma says,

1876
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,040
"How does it happen?

1877
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:38,159
Okay? The words are black and white,

1878
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,480
how does

1879
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:43,199
black and white, you know, uh, uh,

1880
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:45,440
things can end birth and death?"

1881
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:47,440
And Shen Kuang 

1882
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:50,239
couldn't have an answer. Uh.

1883
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:53,040
And this is the lesson I learned: do not

1884
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:55,600
offend the Chinese Patriarchs, the

1885
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:58,000
Chinese Dharma Masters.

1886
01:26:55,600 --> 01:27:00,719
Okay? It's okay for you to offend me

1887
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,080
because I'm not Chinese, uh, uh,

1888
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:05,520

1889
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:07,679
but, but this is a common protocol, uh,

1890
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,600
in that, uh, 

1891
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:11,920
you don't, you don't ask questions that, that

1892
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,040
Dharma Masters cannot answer,

1893
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,440
okay?

1894
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,440
Please.

1895
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,320
And, uh,

1896
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:23,120
but Shen Kuang is able to-

1897
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:26,880
has a little bit of a temper, a temper. He got

1898
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:28,880
very upset and he whipped out his beads, uh,

1899
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:31,120
made of steels,

1900
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:32,560
okay, and whacked them.

1901
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,320
He says, "These are the words of the

1902
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:36,719
demons,"

1903
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:40,320
and broke the two front tooth. So

1904
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:43,320
Bodhidharma has a new nickname! Leon

1905
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,320
Spinks! [Audience laughs] Hm.

1906
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,800
Yeah,

1907
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:56,080
so, uh,

1908
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,080

1909
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:02,400
you know, so whack him and say, "You the

1910
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:04,719
demon! How dare you embarrass me! It's

1911
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,159
the demon's word! You're doing demons',

1912
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:08,239
you know..."

1913
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:11,280
And, and so he broke his teeth because

1914
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:13,520
Bodhidharma didn't dodge at all.

1915
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:16,080
I remember, and

1916
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:18,880
to this point I remember that video of

1917
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:21,760
President Bush, the small one,

1918
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:25,120
when he went to Afghanistan, someone

1919
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,120
threw a shoe at him, [Master Yonghua laughs]

1920
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:31,040
he went like this [Master Yonghua dodges]

1921
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:33,360
He ducked and he ducked in this funny way

1922
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,360
too. [Master Yonghua dodges again]

1923
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:39,520
But Bodhidharma is like a true Indian

1924
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,520
Patriarch,

1925
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:45,600
stood there and

1926
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:45,600
lost two teeth.

1927
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,679
I hope he gets a good dentist. [Audience laughs]

1928
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:58,639
Can you imagine we speak Dharma and then

1929
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:01,040
as we smile, and the front of our mouth

1930
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:03,840
is black? [Maser Yonghua laughs]

1931
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,840
Oh yuh, yuh.

1932
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:07,440
What was he thinking?

1933
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:11,920
I would have ducked myself, like Little

1934
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:12,880
Bush.

1935
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:15,440
And, uh,

1936
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:17,520
Bodhidharma, uh, uh,

1937
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:19,840
apparently, according to Chinese, the

1938
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,440
Chinese wisdom, it says, there's a legend

1939
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,719
where if

1940
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:25,520
a Sage's tooth

1941
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:26,719
fall to the Earth, it would not rain for

1942
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:30,000
three years. That's probably what

1943
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:30,000
happened here in California.

1944
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:38,639
Uh, and so Bodhidharma says, "That would harm a

1945
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:41,360
lot of people,

1946
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,880
so I better take the pain, uh,

1947
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,239
and suffering, uh,

1948
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:46,239
instead of, uh,

1949
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:48,480
letting bad things happen to the Chinese

1950
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:50,840
people, uh,

1951
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:54,159
although they deserve it."

1952
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:55,840
So, so, the tooth fell out, and so he

1953
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:58,159
swallowed it,

1954
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,159
okay?

1955
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:02,000
And then he went away,

1956
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,280
okay?

1957
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,400
And then,

1958
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:07,679
and then,

1959
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:12,480
according to Master Xuan Hua, yes. Did

1960
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:12,480
you have a comment? Black? White? Red?

1961
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:22,239
That, that video person, audio person he sits

1962
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:22,239
like he's in a trance.

1963
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,440
Yeah, Red.

1964
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:27,199
Speaker Red: "Right, yeah, so

1965
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:29,840
my question is,

1966
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:30,800
by swallowing the teeth,

1967
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:33,199
does,

1968
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:35,360
it solves the problem? So it will rain

1969
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:36,639
for three years, or it solved that

1970
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:38,239
problem or-?"

1971
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,679
Master Yong Hua: No, it wouldn't rain for three years for

1972
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:43,600
that. Speaker Red: "It wouldn't rain for three years?" 

1973
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:43,600
Master Yong Hua: You need the dragon's intervention,

1974
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:50,239
but at least there won't be a, uh,

1975
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:53,440
a drought for three years.

1976
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:56,159
Because it would, if, if he let the tooth,

1977
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:57,520
the teeth fell, fall to the ground,

1978
01:30:56,159 --> 01:31:00,520
they would have a drought for three

1979
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:00,520
years.

1980
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:09,440
So, there would be no drought for the next,

1981
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:10,480
because of that, okay?

1982
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,719
So, uh, 

1983
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,719
uh, so, uh,

1984
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,520

1985
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,320

1986
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,440
he swallowed them and disappeared, okay?

1987
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:23,040
And, and, and uh, and so

1988
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:24,800
according to Master Xuan Hua,

1989
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:28,080
I remember this part. Master Xuan Hua

1990
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:30,159
said, uh,

1991
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:32,480
immediately right after that, and you

1992
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:34,000
know, please take a grain of salt, you

1993
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,520
know,

1994
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,159
he's not here so

1995
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:40,800
we don't know.

1996
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:43,440
There's lots of things, folks, I

1997
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,880
wish I were there, because I have so many

1998
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:47,600
questions.

1999
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:50,320
I'm not like a typical American who

2000
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:51,760
are, you know, very afraid of Master Xuan Hua, I

2001
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,679
would have asked him,

2002
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:56,080
"Great Master,

2003
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:58,719
really? I mean I hit the thing and all of

2004
01:31:56,080 --> 01:32:01,120
a sudden, the

2005
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:03,920
fame of Shen Kuang

2006
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:05,760
was supposed to die right away?

2007
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:09,920
Do you buy that or not?"

2008
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:12,480
I find it's, it's too much a coincidence.

2009
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:14,880
What's the rationale for that?

2010
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:17,280
You believe it or not?

2011
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,920
When I read that story, I said,

2012
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,920
"Seriously?

2013
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:26,400
You hit someone and broke two tooth, I

2014
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:28,239
mean Leon Spinks never, you know,

2015
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:31,199
killed anyone because of that. No one

2016
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:31,199
died because of that."

2017
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:37,040
But,

2018
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:40,159
there is a point to this story.

2019
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:41,360
Why did he die immediately?

2020
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:42,159
Because

2021
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:45,600
he

2022
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:48,560
inflicted harm on a

2023
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:51,600
great, great Sage. Supposedly Guan Yin

2024
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:55,520
according to Zhi Gong, which I

2025
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:57,360
respectfully disagree, okay?

2026
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,120
Guan Yin would never fight with the

2027
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:01,440
Bodhisattvas.

2028
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:04,080
Would not compete for,

2029
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:05,120
for blessings from Bodhisattvas, I assure

2030
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,000
you,

2031
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:10,239
okay?

2032
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:12,320
We have so many great Bodhisattvas who

2033
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:14,960
are waiting,

2034
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:19,440
are craving to bring Mahayana from India

2035
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,440
to China. Why would Guan Yin Bodhisattva

2036
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:23,600
steal those

2037
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:24,719
merit and virtues

2038
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,560
from them? Hm?

2039
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:28,159
Think about it, it just didn't make sense

2040
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:30,480
to me, okay?

2041
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:31,760
Anyway!

2042
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,760
Uh, so,

2043
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:37,560
what happened is, this uh, this uh, 

2044
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,560
this monk here,

2045
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:45,600
this monk here,

2046
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:45,600
Shen Kuang, okay,

2047
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:51,920
injured a Great Sage.

2048
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:53,679
For that

2049
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,120
mere fact there,

2050
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:57,679
he's

2051
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:58,719
supposed to fall to

2052
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:03,199
the

2053
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:04,719
Avici Hell, the worst hells there is.

2054
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:07,600
Just for that.

2055
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:10,639
That's how serious it is.

2056
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,639
Okay? And therefore

2057
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:16,960
it's perfectly reasonable to say that

2058
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:19,280
he's supposed to die right away, because

2059
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,880
you know how, how, how big of a name

2060
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:23,440
Bodhidharma was,

2061
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:26,320
then he deserves to die immediately,

2062
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:28,639
because it's very serious offence. 

2063
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,639
So, so,

2064
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:33,440
he's supposed to die, so two ghosts

2065
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,600
came and said,

2066
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:38,239
"Our boss, King Yama would like to have a

2067
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:40,239
word with you," which is the, you know, the

2068
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:42,080
the Underworld, uh,

2069
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:43,119
the word for, uh,

2070
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,719
okay,

2071
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:48,000
it's time for you to go.

2072
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:50,080
Okay, and Bodhidharma said, uh no,

2073
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:54,639
Shen Kuang says,

2074
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:56,159
"Why? I'm so young, in the prime of my life,

2075
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:58,480
you know?

2076
01:34:56,159 --> 01:35:03,119
Can I have some more time?" He said, "Nope!

2077
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:03,119
Your time is up." "Just like that?!" He said, "Yep!"

2078
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:06,320
So, so, uh, 

2079
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:08,560

2080
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:09,280
Shen Kuang, says, "What did I do? What did I

2081
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,840
do?"

2082
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:15,360
And he said, "You don't know? Hah!

2083
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:17,040
You broke the two front teeth

2084
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:18,719
of a Great Sage.

2085
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:22,800
That's why."

2086
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:22,800
And so Shen Kuang says,

2087
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,080
"Uh. Oh.

2088
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,280
I didn't know, if I knew I would have not

2089
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:28,480
done it." Okay?

2090
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:31,440
The ghost says,

2091
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,440
"Not my problem."

2092
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:35,280
okay.

2093
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,480
"Let's go!"

2094
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:37,280
And uh, and uh,

2095
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:39,679

2096
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:41,360
Shen Kuang got on his knees, I think and

2097
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:42,960
then begged to the ghost says, "Look at me,

2098
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:45,679
I'm the Dharma Master, you're the ghost I

2099
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:46,480
beg to you, give me some time, uh, so that I

2100
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:48,239

2101
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:51,600
learned from this monk a little bit so

2102
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:52,480
that my life would not have been in vain."

2103
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,440
Okay?

2104
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,800

2105
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:57,040
And so, uh,

2106
01:35:54,800 --> 01:36:00,560
the ghost must have been a high-ranking ghost, 

2107
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:01,600
he says, "Okay I'm seeing that

2108
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,760
you

2109
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:06,880
are sincere, I allow you a little bit of

2110
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:09,119
time, go and look for that monk and, and uh, and uh,

2111
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,480
do you think, we'll wait a

2112
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:11,520
little bit for you."

2113
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,890
And so

2114
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,400
Shen Kuang, uh, uh,

2115
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:15,760

2116
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:19,360
ran after,

2117
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:21,920
after Bodhidharma. By that time,

2118
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:24,800
okay, Bodhidharma was walking towards

2119
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:27,440
the south, yes he went south.

2120
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,440
Is it south?

2121
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:33,440
No that's Sixth Patrarich, you confused.

2122
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:38,199
So he went somewhere [Master Yong Hua laughs]

2123
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:42,639
And he passed by a house

2124
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:45,360
where

2125
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:47,920
they kept, there's a bird,

2126
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:50,920
is kept in a cage, a bird cage,

2127
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,920
okay?

2128
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,600
And, and uh, and uh

2129
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:58,000

2130
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,000
the bird, uh, uh, uh

2131
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:02,639
recognized Bodhidharma and said, uh,

2132
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:08,000
recognize, somehow this bird recognized

2133
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,080
Bodhidharma as a Sage,

2134
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,719
so the bird asked him,

2135
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:15,360
"Mind from the West, Mind from the West, Teach me

2136
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:16,480
a way, To escape from this cage."

2137
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,800
Uh,

2138
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:21,840
Flaming Hair, can you do it in, in a more

2139
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,840
birdy kind of way?

2140
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:29,840
Try your best.

2141
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,840
Bird language now.

2142
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,880
Very good, very good, yeah.

2143
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:45,360
One more time. [Audience laughs]

2144
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:45,360
Second version.

2145
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:51,440
Unmute it, hey Korea, unmute it.

2146
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:58,080
I can't hear you.

2147
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:59,520
Speaker Flaming Hair: "Can you hear me?" Master Yong Hua: Okay now, now. Go.

2148
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:01,360
Speaker Flaming Hair: "Mind from the West! Mind from the West!

2149
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:04,080
Please teach me how to escape

2150
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:04,080
from this cage!" [Master Yong Hua laughs] [Audience claps]

2151
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:18,960
Uh, and Bodhidharma immediately replied, "Okay,

2152
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:18,960
let's find a new voice."

2153
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:22,630
Uh, uh, China's

2154
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:27,440
Chinese person there.

2155
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:34,320
Huh? Uh.

2156
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:36,400
So Bodhidharma replied, "To escape from

2157
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:37,840
the cage; to escape from the cage,

2158
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:40,080
put out both

2159
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:42,159
legs, close both eyes,

2160
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:45,840
this is a way to escape from the cage!"

2161
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:45,840
Okay, spoke bird language.

2162
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:50,880
Uh, and, and uh, and uh, and uh,and uh, and uh,

2163
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:50,880

2164
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:53,360

2165
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,000

2166
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:59,520
And

2167
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:01,760
that's what the bird did, and uh, the

2168
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:03,840
owner thought the bird was dead, so

2169
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:07,840
opened the cage and tried to

2170
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:10,159
take the body out, but the bird

2171
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:11,199
flew up, okay. So that's how the bird

2172
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:14,560
escaped,

2173
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:16,639
okay. The great escape, if you will, uh,

2174
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:19,280
but the bird escaped.

2175
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:21,679
So anyway, the story, legend has it that Shen

2176
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:23,920
Kuang ran after Bodhidharma

2177
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:27,119
and went all the way to

2178
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:30,480
be a Bear's Ear Mountain in, in Lo Yang,

2179
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:31,920
and uh, sat down facing a wall that's right

2180
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:35,280
behind the

2181
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:36,719
future Shaolin Temple, okay? Hm.

2182
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:38,960
And

2183
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:40,560
Shen Kuang knelt

2184
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:43,760
close by, um,

2185
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:47,840
behind him apparently, for nine years.

2186
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:48,719
And when I read this, I said nine years?

2187
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:52,320
Uh,

2188
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:54,719
how can you do that for nine years?

2189
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:57,199
Well anyway, so he sat for nine years, and

2190
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:59,840
I'm, first question is, uh,

2191
01:39:57,199 --> 01:40:00,960
what about bathroom breaks?

2192
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:03,360

2193
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:05,119
And uh, um, 

2194
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:08,400
and um, uh, 

2195
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:10,159
so they sat behind

2196
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:13,040
MAster Bodhidharma for,

2197
01:40:10,159 --> 01:40:14,800
for nine years, and Bodhidharma ignored

2198
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:16,159
him completely, didn't talk to him for

2199
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,360
nine years,

2200
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:19,199
okay?

2201
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:20,560
And Shen Kuang

2202
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:23,840
never gave up.

2203
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:25,840
It's a test. Hm?

2204
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:29,920
It's a test. And uh,

2205
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:30,639
test of sincerity, okay. And one

2206
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,639
day,

2207
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:35,280
after nine years,

2208
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:35,280
Shen Kuang

2209
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:39,760
never dared bother

2210
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:41,600
Bodhidharma. If you were there and

2211
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,560
begging for instruction, you don't want

2212
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,800
to nag him,

2213
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:46,320

2214
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,960
you know. Xun,

2215
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:53,119
you hear? You don't want to nag.

2216
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:57,440
I would not nag, okay.

2217
01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:57,440
For something important, I would not nag. Uh, uh.

2218
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,760
And, uh, and uh, um, mmm, and uh, and

2219
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,159

2220
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:05,159

2221
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:07,520

2222
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:09,920

2223
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,920
one day, uh, uh, uh,

2224
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,920
Bodhidharma

2225
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,239
asked him a question. This is very

2226
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,960
important. There's a protocol here.

2227
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:19,600
You

2228
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:22,960
would kneel behind, you ask for a favor

2229
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:24,800
you ask once and you wait, okay, you don't

2230
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,480
nag.

2231
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:28,400
And then, and then, so he waited for nine years.

2232
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:30,159
This is beautiful, this is so beautiful

2233
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:31,360
of a story to me,

2234
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:34,560
okay?

2235
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:36,400
It is so important to you, he said, "How do

2236
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:38,560
I end birth and death?

2237
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:39,760
Venerable Master, teach me how to end birth

2238
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,440
and death."

2239
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,040
Alright?

2240
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:46,199
You don't text him

2241
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,199
to death. [Audience laughs]

2242
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:50,159
Okay, you ask once.

2243
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:53,600
How can I end birth and death, and then you

2244
01:41:50,159 --> 01:41:53,600
kneel down and you wait.

2245
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:57,199
You can do anything you like, [Master Yonghua drops head from one side to another]

2246
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:01,840
but you don't nag him anymore.

2247
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:09,239
[Master Yong Hua looks behind] The timing is always perfect! [Audience laughs]

2248
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:22,320
And, and uh, so after nine years,

2249
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:23,840
interestingly, uh, this is so remarkable of Venerable 

2250
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:26,840
Shen Kuang,

2251
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:30,239
I'm impressed by that. That for

2252
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:32,400
us in my era, waiting for nine years

2253
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:34,480
behind him like that is total nonsense,

2254
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:37,119
the sheer nonsense. I don't know about

2255
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:40,719
you, I cannot do this, no way, it doesn't

2256
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:40,719
make sense to me, okay? Uh.

2257
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:45,520
That's why i'm glad that Shen Kuang did

2258
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:45,520
it for us.

2259
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:50,800
Thank you China. [Master Yong Hua looks up]

2260
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:50,800
And, and um, and 

2261
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,920

2262
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:59,280
after nine years, so it's like,

2263
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:01,760
it's interestingly like a delay, how do I,

2264
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:02,719
how do I end birth and death?

2265
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,239
Okay?

2266
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:06,080
And

2267
01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:07,440
Venerable Bodhidharma didn't say anything

2268
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:09,040
for nine years,

2269
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:11,760
ignored him completely. And the guy would

2270
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:13,040
not go away, so after nine years BOdhidharma says,

2271
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,280
"You're still

2272
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:15,280
here?

2273
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:19,040
What's the matter with you?" And he said, "I'm

2274
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:24,119
waiting for the answer," and he said, "I will

2275
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:24,119
answer you when the snow becomes red." Okay?

2276
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:29,280
And so Shen Kuang, uh, uh, uh,  

2277
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:30,719

2278
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:33,679
got so upset

2279
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:35,600
that he took out a knife and cut his

2280
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:39,040
left arm or right arm? This is what I don't

2281
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:41,840
remember. Is it right arm? Right arm,

2282
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:44,159
okay.

2283
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:46,960
I am right-handed, so I think I would take

2284
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:51,480
my left arm, cut my right arm.

2285
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:51,480
It shows more- it's more emphatic. [Master Yong Hua laughs]

2286
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:57,840
So in this movie of mine,

2287
01:43:55,600 --> 01:44:00,400
you take this knife here, this probably

2288
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:04,440
has not been sharpened yet,

2289
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:04,440
and you hack away your armor, [Master Yong Hua laughs]

2290
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:10,400
So anyway, so it finally

2291
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:13,040
cut off and fell to the ground, and the

2292
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:13,760
snow become red, became red. So he scooped

2293
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:16,800
up

2294
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:19,199
some red snow with, tainted with blood,

2295
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:21,040
corrupted with blood,

2296
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:23,440
and then, and then,

2297
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:26,480
and "So great Master, great Master, hey!

2298
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:28,239
This- the snow- there's red snow! The snow

2299
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:29,199
has become red!"

2300
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:32,239
And,

2301
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:33,920
now Master Xuan Hua says,

2302
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:36,320
Venerable Shen Kuang

2303
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:38,239
was so upset, he had a temper so he cut

2304
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:40,960
his arm off to show him. Uh,

2305
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:44,239
he's probably right, I would never

2306
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:46,000
disagree with my, my Chinese teacher,

2307
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:48,310
okay?

2308
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:50,800
Yeah ching! [Master Yong Hua points above his head]

2309
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:52,239
[Master Yong Hua laughs]

2310
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,320
So, so, 

2311
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:55,600
Bodhidharma is impressed,

2312
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:58,880
and um, 

2313
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:59,840
and he said, "Ah! You,

2314
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:03,199
you

2315
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:03,199
are a pretty tough cookie."

2316
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:09,600
And, and um, and um, uh, and uh,

2317
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:12,239

2318
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,239

2319
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:17,119

2320
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:19,280
"So it is, so it is," he says, "Wow you're

2321
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:21,600
tough, so you're tough."

2322
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,600
Okay? Uh. Ru shi. Ru shi. So it is ru shi, ru shi.

2323
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:26,480

2324
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:31,639
"You're so tough, so am I."[Master Yong Hua laughs]

2325
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:31,639
Okay? "You're crazy, so am I."

2326
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:38,000
Uh, and he says, he says uh,

2327
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:40,080

2328
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,080
"You are worthy

2329
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:44,719
to be my student."

2330
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:48,639
Okay? "So I will teach you, I teach you

2331
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:50,400
what I know," okay? And "So my wait has

2332
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:53,520
not been in vain."

2333
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:56,159
Imagine this guy, this great teacher has

2334
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:59,520
been looking for a descendant,

2335
01:45:56,159 --> 01:46:02,639
for a successor, for a long time.

2336
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:04,960
He saw it in Venerable Shen Kuang, but

2337
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:06,159
still put him through the test,

2338
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:10,239
okay?

2339
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:13,360
A lot of, in Buddhism, it's about

2340
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:14,719
enduring uh, the test, okay?

2341
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,560
And uh,

2342
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:18,400
that's called

2343
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:21,199
what?

2344
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:21,199
What is that called?

2345
01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:26,560
Gradual

2346
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:29,440
teaching.

2347
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:30,719
The tests are

2348
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:33,119
gradual

2349
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:33,119
teaching.

2350
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:42,320
You see that? That's how

2351
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:44,719
Mahayana was transmitted from India to

2352
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,719
China.

2353
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:52,960
Gradual teaching for nine years.

2354
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:55,679
So he sat there, he knelt behind him for

2355
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:58,000
nine years. So every day, he said, "Oh my

2356
01:46:55,679 --> 01:47:00,639
legs hurt, and

2357
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:03,600
it hurt so much, what am I doing here? What

2358
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:07,239
am I doing here? I can't even tell my

2359
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:07,239
mother about this.

2360
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:12,480
She doesn't want me to become a monk in

2361
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:14,719
the first place, now I have to tell her

2362
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:17,600
I'm kneeling behind this

2363
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:20,159
dark-skinned monk who cannot speak a

2364
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:22,239
single word of Chinese?

2365
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:24,239
And when he decides to teach me how

2366
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:26,800
we're gonna, what are we gonna use? Google

2367
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:26,800
Translate?"

2368
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:32,880
You see? It has so many issues there

2369
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:35,040
that's unresolved, okay? And yet he knelt,

2370
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:37,600
and Bodhidharma didn't talk to him, he

2371
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:40,880
didn't dare ask, okay?

2372
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:42,560
And, and uh, so,

2373
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:43,280
part of the teaching is

2374
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:45,280
you

2375
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:48,400
need to go through hardship,

2376
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:51,400
because that's part of your gradual

2377
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:51,400
training.

2378
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:58,719
Don't expect shortcuts. They say,

2379
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:00,800
"Tell me the best thing,

2380
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:03,440
Give me the Sudden Teaching

2381
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:05,760
right away, okay?" No,

2382
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:08,719
you have to pass the test,

2383
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:10,639
you have to go through the gradual

2384
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:12,560
training first.

2385
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:15,920
And then there's a final test where you

2386
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,920
actually have to cut off your arm.

2387
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:20,560
Is that a question you asked? Do you have

2388
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:22,960
to cut off your arm, yes.

2389
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:25,360
Speaker: "I have a question-" Master Yonghua: Another question?

2390
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:26,560
Speaker: "It's a little bit random uh it's associated

2391
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:29,040
with what you just talk about the

2392
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:30,159
conversation between Shen Kuang and uh

2393
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:30,960
Bodhidharma..."

2394
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:33,760
Master Yong Hua: Yeah.

2395
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:35,920
Speaker: "Like, I'm curious back then, what kind of

2396
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:38,159
language they are using when they

2397
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:40,320
communicate with each other? Do they

2398
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:42,639
speak Chinese or do they speak Indian

2399
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:45,880
language? How did they communicate with

2400
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:45,880
each other?" [Audience laughs]

2401
01:48:46,450 --> 01:48:50,639
Master Yonghua:

2402
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:50,639
What did I tell you? [Audience laughs]

2403
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:57,600
I will forgive you this one time.

2404
01:48:54,960 --> 01:49:01,360
You never ask a question I cannot answer.

2405
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:03,530
Speaker: "Okay, I'm sorry." [Speaker laughs] Master Yong Hua: Okay, don't do it again.

2406
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:04,800
Next question! [Audience laughs]

2407
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:08,320

2408
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:11,520
How do I know? I wasn't there.

2409
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:12,560
But if I have to lie to you,

2410
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:14,800
okay,

2411
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:15,760
how do they communicate? That's a good

2412
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:20,320
question.

2413
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:22,000
You see, you're so lucky that I, I am so lenient,

2414
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:23,280
because I had the same question too. I

2415
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,960
said, you know

2416
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:27,040
the guy didn't speak Chinese and the

2417
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:28,800
other guy didn't speak Indian,

2418
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:31,040
how could they talk?

2419
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,760
Snow, red and all those things that's a lot of

2420
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:38,320
vocabulary, come on! [Master Yong Hua laughs]

2421
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:38,320
I'm missing something here! Yes, old monk.

2422
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:51,930
Venerable Xian Chi: "Emituofo." [Vietnamese]

2423
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:56,719
Master Yong Hua: Okay, let's let Master Xian Ren

2424
01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:56,719
translate this important message.

2425
01:50:58,239 --> 01:51:02,159
Venerable Xian Ren: "Um Master,

2426
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:03,280
whatever the um,

2427
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:05,360
Sage,

2428
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:07,360
sagely people

2429
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:09,440
did, we cannot uh,

2430
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:10,239
talk about it, but,

2431
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:13,119
uh,

2432
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:15,760
earlier we went through the story that

2433
01:51:13,119 --> 01:51:17,760
the Patriarch talked to the um,

2434
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:20,719
bird. Actually the bird asked the

2435
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:22,639
question and then the Patriarch gave

2436
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:25,599
it the instruction.

2437
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:28,239
And then the bird understand.

2438
01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:30,400
And then another story is Yong-A [?]

2439
01:51:28,239 --> 01:51:33,679
when she meditate

2440
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:35,760
and she saw Amitabha Buddha appeared

2441
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:37,360
wearing a yellow robe,

2442
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:41,440
and she,

2443
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:43,920
uh, in her mind, arrives a question like,

2444
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:46,639
why Amitabha Buddha

2445
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:48,719
wear yellow robe? And suddenly an answer

2446
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:51,119
came to her mind, like

2447
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:52,880
wait until you die that's when I will

2448
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:54,719
wear a red robe.

2449
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:56,480
So the Buddha

2450
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:59,599
can communicate

2451
01:51:56,480 --> 01:52:02,960
through the mind, and the same thing like uh,

2452
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:04,000
in 1976 when I was in the prison and

2453
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:06,400
then I,

2454
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:09,920
in my dream I saw

2455
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:10,639
Buddha appear and then, uh, I

2456
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:12,800

2457
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:14,639
I have a question, I had a question in my

2458
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:17,280
mind, and then suddenly the Buddha

2459
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:18,719
answered me using the Vietnamese. He

2460
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:20,719
didn't use uh,

2461
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:24,000
Chinese or English or whatever, he used

2462
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:26,639
Vietnamese to help me to understand. So

2463
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,480
in the Sutra, Avamtasaka Sutra, 

2464
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:30,320
say that the Buddha

2465
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:34,719
has a lot of different way to

2466
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:34,719
communicate to help beings understand."

2467
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:43,560
Master Yong Hua: You get that? You buy that?

2468
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:43,560
You believe anything, do ya? [sigh]

2469
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:55,159
When you think,

2470
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:55,159
you think in what language?

2471
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:03,040
You think in Chinese, yes? 

2472
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:11,800
Yin, you think in Yietnamese or English?

2473
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:11,800
English, okay. But you Vietnamese, right?

2474
01:53:12,159 --> 01:53:16,639
Okay, Vietnamese-Chinese. Her mother is

2475
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:19,280
Vietnamese-Chinese.

2476
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:21,599
Okay, so you have Chinese here, English

2477
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:21,599
here.

2478
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:30,320
Xiao Tai when you think, what do you

2479
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:30,320
think? In what language do you use?

2480
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:38,480
Speaker Xiao Tai: "Chinese and English." Master Yong Hua: Chinese and English!

2481
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:40,560
Half-Chinese, half-English. Very good.

2482
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:41,440
Okay, you see? Uh,

2483
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:42,560
so, uh, so uh,

2484
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:43,760

2485
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,440

2486
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:47,040
what happened

2487
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:49,679
is that

2488
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:52,080
the thinking-

2489
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:55,080
do you really think is in Chinese or

2490
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:55,080
English?

2491
01:53:55,520 --> 01:54:02,400
How come she thinks in English, how come

2492
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:02,400
you think in in Chinese?

2493
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:06,480
Before you verbalize it, right?

2494
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:07,940
when you think

2495
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:12,480
Chinese- [Master Yong Hua mimicks Chinese sounds]

2496
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:12,480
[Master Yong Hua laughs] And Yin would say [Master Yong Hua mimics Chinese sounds] [Master Yong Hua laughs]

2497
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:21,040
So,

2498
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:24,159
these are thoughts. How come

2499
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:28,320
she sees, she hears herself as in Chinese, and

2500
01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:28,320
she hears herself as English? Why?

2501
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:36,960
My Master,

2502
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:38,880
when I was a novice and I was supposed

2503
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:41,920
to be trained to sit sleep,

2504
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:42,800
okay? And I hated it. I hated it.

2505
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:44,719
Say,

2506
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,880
we suffer all day,

2507
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:49,440
ate one meal a day, and we can't even

2508
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:51,599
sleep within comfort? What kind of what

2509
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:53,280
kind of, kind of, nonsense is this? So I really

2510
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:55,599
struggled with that concept of having to

2511
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:57,520
sit-sleep. And I tried two years

2512
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:59,760
unsuccessfully,

2513
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:59,760
okay?

2514
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:04,320
And then one night in Long Beach

2515
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:06,080
Monastery, hm,

2516
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:09,440
after two years,

2517
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:12,480
okay, I was sleeping. I started as usual with,

2518
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:16,000
with sitting, and then eventually I slide

2519
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:18,400
down slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly and

2520
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,360
lean against the wall, and then pretty

2521
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:22,560
soon

2522
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:22,560
you unbuckle a little bit, [Audience laughs],

2523
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:28,239
a little bit, very slow motion

2524
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:28,239
and eventually. [Master Yong Hua leans back further and makes noise of conent]

2525
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:34,239

2526
01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:37,040
Like that!

2527
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:37,040
No, no, not even- [Master Yong Hua laughs]

2528
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,360
Actually he's listening to our lecture,

2529
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:47,840
seriously?

2530
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:47,840
He's not even playing with his kids out there?

2531
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:55,280

2532
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:57,199
Uh, and, and

2533
01:55:55,280 --> 01:56:02,400
one night, I was doing that like every

2534
01:55:57,199 --> 01:56:02,400
single night, okay, and one night I heard, I heard

2535
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:06,560

2536
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:07,440
Master Xuan Hua's voice,

2537
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:10,000
okay?

2538
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:11,280
He said, he said ,uh,

2539
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,520

2540
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,520

2541
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:16,159
"Get up!

2542
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:19,599
Cross your legs!"

2543
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:23,920
He's screaming at me. Seriously.

2544
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,599
And I immediately jumped up, crossed my

2545
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:31,840
legs, [Master Yong Hua laughs]

2546
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:34,960
without thinking. 

2547
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:37,119
I was so scared.

2548
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:38,800
I never saw

2549
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:40,880
him that angry.

2550
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:44,639
I always have this, you know, the last

2551
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:47,679
time I saw him was, you know, he was dying.

2552
01:56:44,639 --> 01:56:50,080
Okay? He was on his deathbed. He said, "Oh I

2553
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:52,080
love you, you know, and you're all so good,

2554
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:53,520
you're such a wonderful student," and so

2555
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:56,480
forth, okay?

2556
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:59,360
But never been that angry before,

2557
01:56:56,480 --> 01:57:01,920
okay? I was so scared, I immediately

2558
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:04,000
crossed my legs, and sat the rest of the

2559
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:06,639
night in full lotus.

2560
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:08,000
And right after that, I could easily sit

2561
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:11,639
in full lotus.

2562
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,639
Every single night.

2563
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:16,719
Okay?

2564
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:16,719
And the instruction he gave me was?

2565
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:19,280
Yin?

2566
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:26,480
Yin! I call you! I'm looking at her, but I'm

2567
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:26,480
calling your name! [Audience laughs] Yin,

2568
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:35,280
it's the first time you attend my Sutra

2569
01:57:33,199 --> 01:57:37,599
lecture and can't I make use of you as a

2570
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:40,159
prop?

2571
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:43,679
After 10 years, you've finally attended my

2572
01:57:40,159 --> 01:57:43,679
Sutra lecture, the first time.

2573
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:47,280
Is that right? You never attended my

2574
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:52,440
lecture.

2575
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:52,440
That didn't count, not until today. [Audience laughs] 

2576
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:08,400
Exactly! Speaker: "I think he spoke in English!" Master Yong Hua: Exactly. He

2577
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:08,400
spoke in English.

2578
01:58:09,119 --> 01:58:13,679
Okay, yeah.

2579
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:13,679
Why?

2580
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:17,440
Speaker: "It's more direct?

2581
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:22,080
I think that's all I could think of."

2582
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:25,599
Master Yong Hua: Because

2583
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:25,599
I think in English.

2584
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:30,960
I don't think in Vietnamese. I think in

2585
01:58:29,119 --> 01:58:32,880
English.

2586
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:34,719
Unless I talk to the Vietnamese, and then

2587
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:37,840
I think in Vietnamese.

2588
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:38,800
But typically, when I talk to normal

2589
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:41,920
people,

2590
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:44,239
non-Vietnamese, I think in English.

2591
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:46,719
But when I talk to the old monk,

2592
01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:49,440
then I switch to Vietnamese in my thoughts.

2593
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:50,400
Just like you. That's just like uh, 

2594
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:53,360
the boy,

2595
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:53,360
what happened to him now?

2596
01:58:54,639 --> 01:59:01,360
Okay? So the point here is that

2597
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:03,760
if Master Xuan Hua can talk to me in English,

2598
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:04,960
to make sure I understood, because that's

2599
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:06,239
my

2600
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:08,080
pattern.

2601
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:09,760
Unless you're Vietnamese,

2602
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:11,760
I only think in

2603
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:14,000
English.

2604
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:16,880
So in order to teach me,

2605
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:18,480
he used English to make sure I got the

2606
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:21,040
message,

2607
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:24,239
immediately. No interpretation, no

2608
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:27,119
translation. Yes green!

2609
01:59:24,239 --> 01:59:29,599
Speaker Green: "Is it really he spoke English or-" Master Yong Hua: Yes.

2610
01:59:27,119 --> 01:59:32,320
Speaker Green: "Or is it just your mind translated?" Master Yong Hua: I heard

2611
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:35,050
his voice, that anger.

2612
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:36,560
I am traumatized.

2613
01:59:35,050 --> 01:59:40,360

2614
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:40,360
For the rest of my life.

2615
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:50,080
And as I just

2616
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:50,800
think about, revisit that moment i'm

2617
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:53,119
still

2618
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:56,000
shaking right now.

2619
01:59:53,119 --> 01:59:56,000
It's how scary,

2620
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:59,760
he's violent. That's when I first learned

2621
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:01,520
about violence.

2622
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:04,080
It's okay to be violent towards your own

2623
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:04,080
disciples.

2624
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:07,360
Okay?

2625
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:09,760
Yes? 

2626
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:10,719
So, so the point here is that, uh,

2627
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:13,840

2628
02:00:10,719 --> 02:00:13,840
here's what happens.

2629
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,840
Your thought has no language.

2630
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:24,080
Thoughts have no language. For example,

2631
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:26,960
when I taught that boy yesterday,

2632
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:30,159
the troublemaker,

2633
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:30,159
about shame on you,

2634
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,480
okay?

2635
02:00:31,010 --> 02:00:34,320

2636
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:37,040
When he was about to cry, you remember?

2637
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:39,920
You know, he fell on his butt, his right

2638
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:43,199
butt, and he got up and he was

2639
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:46,000
going like this [Master Yong Hua looks up and rubs his behind] and he's about to cry,

2640
02:00:43,199 --> 02:00:46,000
I laughed at him.

2641
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:48,560

2642
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:50,400
So I said,

2643
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:51,360
"Shame on you!"

2644
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:53,679
You know?

2645
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:54,400
And he immediately got the message,

2646
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:56,719
okay?

2647
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:59,440
That right there, when I taught him right

2648
02:00:56,719 --> 02:01:03,040
there, talking about shame, okay?

2649
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:03,040
It's not in English at all.

2650
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:09,360
It's not in Chinese at all. He does not

2651
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:11,920
understand Chinese.

2652
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:13,520
I only taught him about this conce-

2653
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:15,920
thought called

2654
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:15,920
shame.

2655
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:20,800
And he got it right away. He stood up and he

2656
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:23,360
didn't cry, he stopped. He's

2657
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:25,119
about to cry so I immediately tested him,

2658
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:27,679
and said you should be ashamed instead

2659
02:01:25,119 --> 02:01:29,760
of crying! So immediately, he said, "Yeah, I'm not

2660
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:33,000
going to cry!" So he ran over there and he

2661
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:33,000
hid himself. Okay?

2662
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:40,960
So the communications

2663
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:42,639
had no language. He got it.

2664
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:44,639
So yesterday, I was playing with him, I

2665
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:47,040
taught him five different emotions, and

2666
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:49,280
he got them all.

2667
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:50,960
So the thought

2668
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:52,800
in communication

2669
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:54,400
has no language.

2670
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:56,560
But you

2671
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:59,679
add another layer on top of yourself

2672
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:03,360
because you need to talk to

2673
02:01:59,679 --> 02:02:06,080
your thinking mind. So that's why you

2674
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:08,480
translated internally. You're wiring it, it

2675
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:12,159
translated from that thought language,

2676
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:16,000
which is pure thoughts into

2677
02:02:12,159 --> 02:02:16,000
Engli-, uh, Chinese, excuse me.

2678
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:20,080
Taiwanese or Chinese?

2679
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:22,080
Chinese.

2680
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:23,360
Mandarin.

2681
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:27,760
Okay?

2682
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:27,760
Whereas, that one there is in English.

2683
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:32,880
Okay? So,

2684
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:35,360
that's why,

2685
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:37,840
that's how they could communicate.

2686
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:38,639
It turns out, by the way, uh,

2687
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:40,320
for

2688
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:43,520
important lessons,

2689
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:44,719
important teachings, you cannot afford

2690
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:46,320
to

2691
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:47,199
be

2692
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:49,280
uh, be, 

2693
02:02:47,199 --> 02:02:51,840
distracted by languages.

2694
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:53,920
So i'm sure that Bodhidharma, Venerable 

2695
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:55,679
Bodhidharma, he, when he wanted to teach

2696
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:57,119
Shen Kuang,

2697
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:59,760
he could talk to him directly through

2698
02:02:57,119 --> 02:03:01,280
his mind, and Shen Kuang could understand,

2699
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:03,520
okay? And the,

2700
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:04,639
this is the storytelling where Master Xuan Hua

2701
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:07,040

2702
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:10,719
would explain it to us in Chinese and we

2703
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:12,239
translate it into English, so

2704
02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:15,040
it's, it's for our

2705
02:03:12,239 --> 02:03:18,880
understanding. But for them, it's direct,

2706
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:19,760
very direct, mind to mind, if you will.

2707
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:21,199
Okay?

2708
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:23,440
Just like you, um,

2709
02:03:21,199 --> 02:03:23,440
Venerable Bodhidharma

2710
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:29,599
sent him a thought, okay? Talked him in,

2711
02:03:27,119 --> 02:03:31,840
in thoughts and Shen Kuang would translate

2712
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:35,119
that thought into Chinese,

2713
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:35,119
if you will. That's what happened.

2714
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:39,280
Does it help?

2715
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:43,159
Okay. Just remember,

2716
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:43,159
no more questions today. [Audience laughs]

2717
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:50,480
But he's, the old monk is correct, okay?

2718
02:03:48,239 --> 02:03:52,560
He's right, but you understand

2719
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:55,840
that's exactly-

2720
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:57,679
the first layer is thought language.

2721
02:03:55,840 --> 02:04:00,320
Thought has no language.

2722
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:02,639
Thought is just thought. When you,

2723
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:03,599
you do mind, you're able to read minds

2724
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:06,159
like

2725
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:09,040
Venerable Bodhidharma, okay? You can read

2726
02:04:06,159 --> 02:04:11,440
people's mind, that has no language, okay?

2727
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:14,239
He can read your mind her mind, your mind

2728
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:16,159
is in Chinese, her mind's Vietnamese, and

2729
02:04:14,239 --> 02:04:18,960
his mind, God knows what language, we

2730
02:04:16,159 --> 02:04:21,360
don't know, okay? So it doesn't matter at

2731
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:22,800
all. So the first layer is thought,

2732
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:26,960
thought is just thought.

2733
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:26,960
And then next layer is language.

2734
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:33,040
Alright? That's how it works.

2735
02:04:30,719 --> 02:04:33,040
Next! Hm.

2736
02:04:33,119 --> 02:04:36,239
So

2737
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:39,440
this

2738
02:04:36,239 --> 02:04:41,040
gradual teaching that Bodhidharma did

2739
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:43,920
for Shen Kuang,

2740
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:45,920
spanned nine years.

2741
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:48,960
It's very important.

2742
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:53,199
Okay? Do not expect

2743
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:54,800
immediate results. Like we, in our era,

2744
02:04:53,199 --> 02:04:59,280
are accustomed to

2745
02:04:54,800 --> 02:05:00,239
instant gratification. It takes time,

2746
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:02,000
okay?

2747
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:03,440
It takes time

2748
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,119
to prepare,

2749
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:07,840
it takes time

2750
02:05:05,119 --> 02:05:07,840
to

2751
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:13,520
let the wine mature

2752
02:05:10,639 --> 02:05:15,760
properly. You cannot rush it. Even soy

2753
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:19,280
sauce

2754
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:20,719
needs to be matured naturally.

2755
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,920
Is that clear?

2756
02:05:20,719 --> 02:05:24,800
Or

2757
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:27,840
fish sauce for that matter.

2758
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:27,840
Go ahead Wei Mountain.

2759
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:31,599
Speaker from Wei Mountain Temple: "Master, when the, that baby yesterday you

2760
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:35,300
played, 

2761
02:05:31,599 --> 02:05:38,320
that he fall down, did you read his mind?"

2762
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:40,560
[Audience laughs]

2763
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:40,560
Master Yong Hua: Yes. 

2764
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:47,960
Now you mentioned it...

2765
02:05:43,599 --> 02:05:47,960
now you brought it up, yes.

2766
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:53,760
Oh what a stupid question. Of course I

2767
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:53,760
did [Master Yong Hua luaghs] I mean uh-

2768
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:02,400
occasionally. Because yesterday

2769
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:06,079
I

2770
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:06,880
finally found my soul mate, uh,

2771
02:06:06,079 --> 02:06:09,360
a

2772
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:11,920
mischievous mind.

2773
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:13,760
That boy was causing trouble all

2774
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:16,320
afternoon for four hours, while you were

2775
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:18,719
here, the small gathering, like

2776
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:20,639
five, six of us gathered together and

2777
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:23,199
talking, and telling your stories and so

2778
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:25,280
forth. And the boy was, you know,

2779
02:06:23,199 --> 02:06:28,639
creating mischief after mischief and

2780
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:30,800
so forth. And I was like, oh this boy sounds like my kind

2781
02:06:28,639 --> 02:06:32,800
of soul mate.

2782
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:34,480
So it intrigued me so I was

2783
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:36,480
starting to, I started paying

2784
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:39,599
attention to what he was going through his

2785
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:42,960
mind. How does he create mischiefs? So I

2786
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:43,679
was more intrigued by that, okay?

2787
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:46,320
So

2788
02:06:43,679 --> 02:06:48,800
I was able to connect with him

2789
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:51,520
at that mischievous level, that's it. And

2790
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:52,800
you call it thought-reading, mind-reading,

2791
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:55,280
so be it.

2792
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:55,280
Guilty.

2793
02:06:55,840 --> 02:07:01,760
Okay? [Master Yong Hua laughs] Uh.

2794
02:06:57,040 --> 02:07:04,480
So anyway, so Bodhidharma, uh, uh,

2795
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:06,560
so the real question is, now, how does he

2796
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:08,800
transmit the teaching, mind to mind

2797
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:11,599
teaching. This is

2798
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:13,360
very, very precise language. How is he

2799
02:07:11,599 --> 02:07:15,280
gonna teach something he does not

2800
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:16,639
understand the language, or speak the

2801
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:18,800
language?

2802
02:07:16,639 --> 02:07:21,760
Okay, you, I would not dare use

2803
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:23,119
the Chinese to teach you mind to mind,

2804
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:27,760
for example.

2805
02:07:23,119 --> 02:07:28,719
Never because my Chinese is horrible.

2806
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:30,159
Okay,

2807
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:34,079
so

2808
02:07:30,159 --> 02:07:37,040
but Bodhidharma decided to transmit

2809
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:39,280
the Sudden Teaching. The Chan Dharma Door

2810
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:40,400
here,

2811
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:43,520
okay?

2812
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:45,520
Translation for you: Chan Dharma Door here

2813
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:47,599
is Sudden Teaching.

2814
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:49,199
Because he taught the Chan Dharma Door for

2815
02:07:47,599 --> 02:07:51,440
nine years already,

2816
02:07:49,199 --> 02:07:52,560
the Gradual Dharma Door,

2817
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:53,599
okay?

2818
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:54,719
Venerable SHen Kuang

2819
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:55,920
saw

2820
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:58,880
how

2821
02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:01,760
Bodhidharma was teaching him, not by

2822
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:04,760
language, not by thoughts but by,

2823
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:04,760
what?

2824
02:08:08,239 --> 02:08:10,800
By what? [Master Yong Hua shakes his head] Mmm.

2825
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:16,800
By what? 

2826
02:08:17,199 --> 02:08:20,400
Yes Chinese person?

2827
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:23,679
Speaker Chinese person: "Tests? Tests?"

2828
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:26,400
Master Yong Hua: No tests. That's too Chinese.

2829
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:26,400
Anyone else?

2830
02:08:28,239 --> 02:08:32,000
Yes,

2831
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:32,000
from the Philippines. [Audience laughs]

2832
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:38,960
You want to make it sound so, like we

2833
02:08:35,119 --> 02:08:38,960
so international! [Audience laughs]

2834
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:49,040
Yes. Speaker from the Philippines: "By his behavior."

2835
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:50,719
Master Yong Hua: Nope, wrong, Philippines doesn't have it. [Audience laughs]

2836
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:53,599
Yellow, yes.

2837
02:08:50,719 --> 02:08:56,320
Speaker Yellow: "Emituofo uh he sat for nine

2838
02:08:53,599 --> 02:08:56,320
years as well."

2839
02:09:00,079 --> 02:09:05,639
Master Yong Hua: [Master Yong Hua yawns] [Audience laughs] Anyone else? Old monk, I'm sure the old

2840
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:05,639
monk wants to say something.

2841
02:09:10,830 --> 02:09:16,719
[Audience laughs] Venerable Xian Chi: [Vietnamese]

2842
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:20,800
Master Yong Hua: Eeeh! Don't even translate! [Audience laughs]

2843
02:09:16,719 --> 02:09:20,800
Green. Speaker Green: "By, uh, let him suffer."

2844
02:09:24,159 --> 02:09:28,400
Master Yong Hua: Pretty good.

2845
02:09:26,159 --> 02:09:29,840
Not quite, but yeah, it's pretty good, it's

2846
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:32,560
pretty good.

2847
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:34,239
It's pretty good, excellent. And you are

2848
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:36,880
devious.

2849
02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:39,360
I would be careful, you know, if I were

2850
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:39,360
your husband.

2851
02:09:40,719 --> 02:09:44,199
Anyone else?

2852
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:51,440
By?

2853
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:58,239
Doing.

2854
02:09:59,679 --> 02:10:03,040
So, for example, this is just my

2855
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:05,520
imagination,

2856
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:07,199
okay? Please take a grain of salt,. There's

2857
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:09,920
no proof.

2858
02:10:07,199 --> 02:10:09,920
Don't ask me [Master Yong Hua points at an audience member]

2859
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:14,239
how do you know?

2860
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,320
I was talking a Korean person, you know,

2861
02:10:14,239 --> 02:10:19,199
two nights ago and she says,

2862
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:19,199
"Why are you so sure?"

2863
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:27,520
You don't ask someone that, you know, are

2864
02:10:25,119 --> 02:10:28,719
you sure? How can you be so sure? I just,

2865
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:29,599

2866
02:10:28,719 --> 02:10:31,360
it's

2867
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:33,760
not proper.

2868
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:33,760
Anyway,

2869
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:39,679
what Bodhidharma did for Shen Kuang is

2870
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:43,040
that,

2871
02:10:39,679 --> 02:10:44,880
if you can imagine Shen Kuang is

2872
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:48,800
hot stuff,

2873
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:52,719
he's revered by lay people, he's uh, 

2874
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:55,199
he's well respected, impressed by the

2875
02:10:52,719 --> 02:10:57,440
heavenly beings, okay? He's a hot shot,

2876
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:59,840
okay? But Shen Kuang is not used to

2877
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:02,480
kneeling behind someone like that.

2878
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:04,159
So initially, I assure you Shen Kuang had

2879
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:07,440
thoughts of quitting.

2880
02:11:04,159 --> 02:11:10,639
He said, "This is nonsense,

2881
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:14,159
okay? It's going nowhere. What am I doing?

2882
02:11:10,639 --> 02:11:16,320
Let's go back and face death.

2883
02:11:14,159 --> 02:11:18,960
It's less embarrassing than this. How can

2884
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:20,400
I explain to my supporters I kneeled behind

2885
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:21,840
this dark

2886
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:24,960
skinned monk,

2887
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:25,840
bushy beard,

2888
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:29,199
who

2889
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:29,199
ignores me completely?"

2890
02:11:29,599 --> 02:11:32,480
Okay? Hm.

2891
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:35,280
And

2892
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:36,960
when these thoughts of quitting

2893
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:41,199
arose in, in, in the, in

2894
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:42,079
Shen Kuang's mind, Bodhidharma

2895
02:11:41,199 --> 02:11:44,800
would

2896
02:11:42,079 --> 02:11:44,800
do something- [Master Yong Hua heavily coughing]-

2897
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:49,599
and the thought would die.

2898
02:11:51,119 --> 02:11:56,960
Okay? So Shen Kuang actually

2899
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:59,360
received help from Bodhidharma, uh,

2900
02:11:56,960 --> 02:12:02,159
invisibly, otherwise there's no way

2901
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:03,520
Shen Kuang could have lasted nine years.

2902
02:12:02,159 --> 02:12:07,280
So what

2903
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:08,880
Bodhidharma did for Shen Kuang is that

2904
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:10,719
he

2905
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:12,800
invisibly

2906
02:12:10,719 --> 02:12:15,360
helped Shen Kuang

2907
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:18,079
not quit.

2908
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:20,800
Otherwise he would have quit nine years ago, a

2909
02:12:18,079 --> 02:12:22,159
long, long, time ago. Does it make sense to

2910
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:24,880
you?

2911
02:12:22,159 --> 02:12:27,760
No ordinary person, unless they be, they

2912
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:29,920
are a sage, would do this silly thing for

2913
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:35,360
nine years. That's impossible. That's

2914
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:37,599
totally nonsense. Unless he was helped.

2915
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:38,480
Is that clear?

2916
02:12:37,599 --> 02:12:41,440
Okay?

2917
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:43,520
So don't be so full yourself.

2918
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:45,119
Your progress actually

2919
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:47,679
is, rece-,

2920
02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:50,960
your practice has a lot of help from a

2921
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:54,000
lot of good guys. We're on the good side

2922
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:55,760
of the fence, of the railroad tracks, okay?

2923
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:59,119
When you do this good thing here, you

2924
02:12:55,760 --> 02:13:02,000
receive so much help, trust me.

2925
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:04,320
So Shen Kuang got help from Bodhidharma,

2926
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:06,480
because Bodhidharma would make sure that

2927
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:08,239
he was not,

2928
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:10,719
he would not quit,

2929
02:13:08,239 --> 02:13:13,520
okay? And then for example,

2930
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:14,800
in the summertime it's very, very hot,

2931
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:17,199
okay, uh,

2932
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:19,760
and Shen Kuang was perspiring for

2933
02:13:17,199 --> 02:13:21,679
example, and he said, "I can't take this

2934
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:25,360
much, I'm going to pass out this heat," and

2935
02:13:21,679 --> 02:13:25,360
all of a sudden, there's this light breeze. [Master Yong Hua blows gently]

2936
02:13:26,239 --> 02:13:31,760
So the Dharma protectors would

2937
02:13:30,239 --> 02:13:34,960
blow air,

2938
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:34,960
cool air, not hot air.

2939
02:13:35,679 --> 02:13:39,679
Seriously, when you're hot, someone does

2940
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:41,920
this for you,

2941
02:13:39,679 --> 02:13:44,800
it changes you, it gives you the kind of

2942
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:46,480
relief that's so much appreciated.

2943
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:49,119
So Shen Kuang

2944
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:51,119
had a lot of help, a lot of support,

2945
02:13:49,119 --> 02:13:53,840
because not only

2946
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:55,920
Bodhidharma was helping him, the Dharma

2947
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:58,079
protectors around Venera-

2948
02:13:55,920 --> 02:14:00,159
Venerable Bodhidharma was

2949
02:13:58,079 --> 02:14:03,599
also assisting him,

2950
02:14:00,159 --> 02:14:05,840
you know ,in so many invisible ways.

2951
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:07,599
We on the good side guys, if you think

2952
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:10,079
that the demons are causing a lot of

2953
02:14:07,599 --> 02:14:14,239
problems out there, I assure you the good

2954
02:14:10,079 --> 02:14:15,920
guys are also helping us as well.

2955
02:14:14,239 --> 02:14:17,280
Okay?

2956
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:20,159
That's what happened.

2957
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:22,880
That's the only way that this could have

2958
02:14:20,159 --> 02:14:22,880
transpired,

2959
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:26,360
in my opinion.

2960
02:14:27,119 --> 02:14:29,520
Lesson?

2961
02:14:29,599 --> 02:14:34,639
Don't be so full of yourself.

2962
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:40,599
We're receiving a lot of help,

2963
02:14:34,639 --> 02:14:40,599
a lot more help than we are aware of.

2964
02:14:47,199 --> 02:14:51,480
Alright? Hm.

2965
02:14:48,239 --> 02:14:51,480
So anyway, uh, hm, okay. And

2966
02:14:55,199 --> 02:14:57,520

2967
02:14:56,320 --> 02:15:00,960

2968
02:14:57,520 --> 02:15:00,960
why do we go into

2969
02:15:03,599 --> 02:15:05,840
Da Hui Song? Or Zhong?

2970
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:11,119
Zhong,

2971
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:12,880
whatever, okay. So anyway, the main

2972
02:15:11,119 --> 02:15:16,159
thing here, I don't know why we got into this, this, uh, this uh

2973
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:18,880
Da Hui here,

2974
02:15:16,159 --> 02:15:20,800
okay, but the interesting

2975
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:24,159
point here, is that

2976
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:25,520
Venerable Bodhidharma

2977
02:15:24,159 --> 02:15:27,360
transmitted

2978
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:29,520
the Sudden Teaching

2979
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:31,840
to Shen Kuang.

2980
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:34,239
Okay, and that

2981
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:37,840
is the seal

2982
02:15:34,239 --> 02:15:40,320
behind the transmission from generation to

2983
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:41,440
generation.

2984
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:42,560
Somehow,

2985
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:43,010
they have

2986
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:44,079
to

2987
02:15:43,010 --> 02:15:46,639

2988
02:15:44,079 --> 02:15:48,880
transmit the Sudden Teaching to the next

2989
02:15:46,639 --> 02:15:52,400
generation,

2990
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:53,360
because that is the essence of

2991
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:56,000
Chan.

2992
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:58,880
That is essence of Mahayana.

2993
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:00,560
I'm sorry Korean Sunims,

2994
02:15:58,880 --> 02:16:02,719
Chan is not,

2995
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:03,520
it's not, uh,

2996
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:05,840
Seon

2997
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:06,960
is not, is not, uh, Hua Tou,

2998
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:10,719

2999
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:14,199
okay? Seon is

3000
02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:14,199
the Sudden Teaching.

3001
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:27,360
That's how you can tell whether you have

3002
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:28,960
real Chan or not. For example

3003
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:31,119
in Japan,

3004
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:33,280
they don't have Sudden Teaching at all.

3005
02:16:31,119 --> 02:16:34,080
There's no mention of it,

3006
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:37,040
yeah,

3007
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:39,040
from the documents I read in English.

3008
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:42,319
No mention of Sudden teaching. It's all

3009
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:46,760
about you know more Hinayana 

3010
02:16:42,319 --> 02:16:46,760
aspects of Chan, of meditation.

3011
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:49,518
Alright?

3012
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:52,880
Uh, 

3013
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:55,200
anyway,

3014
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:56,719
I don't know why we had 43 here, this Da Hui

3015
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:57,678
here,

3016
02:16:56,719 --> 02:17:00,399
uh,

3017
02:16:57,678 --> 02:17:01,678
real Chan, real Chan is [uninteliigible]

3018
02:17:00,399 --> 02:17:02,960

3019
02:17:01,678 --> 02:17:04,960
So, so, so, 

3020
02:17:02,960 --> 02:17:07,200
after

3021
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:09,040
Venerable Bodhidharma

3022
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:10,240
taught

3023
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:11,920
Shen Kuang, okay,

3024
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:13,359
that

3025
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:16,160
special

3026
02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:18,719
Sudden Teaching right there, Shen Kuang

3027
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:23,040
immediately became enlightened. That's

3028
02:17:18,719 --> 02:17:23,040
how you transmit the Sudden Teaching.

3029
02:17:23,678 --> 02:17:28,478
Then Bodhidharma recognized Shen Kuang, uh,

3030
02:17:27,518 --> 02:17:29,678

3031
02:17:28,478 --> 02:17:32,558
was, was uh, was uh, was

3032
02:17:29,678 --> 02:17:34,000
right there at the

3033
02:17:32,558 --> 02:17:35,760
threshold,

3034
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,040
okay,

3035
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:40,319
and then,

3036
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:44,719
Shen Kuang who later became Hui Ke, uh, 

3037
02:17:40,319 --> 02:17:46,399
said, "Uh, uh, now that the arm hurts," uh,

3038
02:17:44,719 --> 02:17:49,678
and he says, 

3039
02:17:46,399 --> 02:17:53,120
"My, my, I am troubled by the pain in my

3040
02:17:49,678 --> 02:17:56,478
arm. Okay? Please help me

3041
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:58,719
calm my mind down." And Bodhidharma says,

3042
02:17:56,478 --> 02:18:00,160
"Bring me your mind, I will calm it down

3043
02:17:58,719 --> 02:18:02,960
for you,"

3044
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:04,960
and Hui Ke says,

3045
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:08,240
"Uhh... I can't find my mind, how can I bring it

3046
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:09,920
to you?" okay he said, "Then I pacify your

3047
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:13,120
mind."

3048
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:14,440
And is, and at that point Hui Ke, Hui Ke

3049
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:16,319
then

3050
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:19,840

3051
02:18:16,319 --> 02:18:24,120
crossed the threshold, and went into the

3052
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:24,120
world, the realm of Enlightenment.

3053
02:18:27,518 --> 02:18:35,518
Time is up? Oh my God, time is up.

3054
02:18:32,399 --> 02:18:35,518
So sorry Korea. Uh.

3055
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:39,280
Okay? S‮o

3056
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:43,040
we end here today, thank you all for

3057
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:46,000
coming. And I'm sorry I exceeded the time

3058
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:46,960
limit. Next time we continue 45

3059
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:50,200
okay?

3060
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:50,200
Thank you.

3061
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:35,840
