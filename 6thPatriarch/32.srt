19
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:43,090
hello everyone today is the 20th of august
2022. we're here to continue discussing the

20
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:52,020
second chapter of the six page rate track
sutra here on slide 200 he's in the midst

21
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:59,010
of explaining teaching us about practical
wisdom tragic wisdom refers to again the

22
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:15,230
supreme wisdom that [Music] [Applause] [Music]
[Applause]

23
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:22,090
impressive uh several seconds that you have
to hold my breath and tell you about this

24
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:28,230
ultimate truth here you know wonderful that's
what it says if it's important enough they

25
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:36,020
come and stop you and and uh distract you
um what was it about again okay so the strategy

26
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:45,180
wisdom is the kind of wisdom that you supreme
wisdom you have we all have not just the Buddhas

27
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:53,070
we all have this wisdom and the Buddha realizes
that because of that

28
00:08:53,070 --> 00:09:00,230
all of us can be much better off so he came
to our world and taught us about the spiritual

29
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:06,920
wisdom here and trained us how to

30
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:14,410
access it how to activate it and how to manipulate
it okay and so that's um uh the purpose of

31
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:20,660
this uh this sutra the sutra is the sixth
page taught us about the spiritual wisdom

32
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:30,010
and this is designed its instructions are
designed to um help us uh connect with that

33
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:38,910
prajna wisdom and utilize it all right

34
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:45,730
okay so the context for your context uh the
text says uh let me repeat it for you what

35
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:52,330
is meant by no thought no thought means to
view all dharma of the mind undefiled by attachment

36
00:09:52,330 --> 00:10:00,030
the function pervades all places but is nowhere
attached okay so he explains that when you

37
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:08,270
have this project wisdom you when you are
in the state of wisdom your mind is free of

38
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:19,370
thoughts it's no thoughts okay in contrast
your mind now is constantly filled with thoughts

39
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:26,990
this is our natural state of mind when we
wake up in the morning we start we we start

40
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:35,840
thinking and it goes like that thank you it
was like that non-stop until we fall asleep

41
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:42,880
and we really are uh not trained never learn
how to help go on sit down guys take photo

42
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:51,580
photo master and the kids smile remember the
smile huh okay

43
00:10:51,580 --> 00:11:03,580
okay so the uh yeah the camera captured already
thank you

44
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:14,690
so we uh our heads are filled up with thoughts
and we have no way of stopping them okay so

45
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:22,730
the Buddhist practices are designed to help
us develop this ability to stop thoughts uh

46
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:29,910
first and then after you are able to stop
your thoughts then you'll be able to wield

47
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:37,440
this project wisdom access its fracture wisdom
okay suppression wisdom is a little bit more

48
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:45,410
advanced than no tarts advanced no thoughts
if you will okay um now so what does it mean

49
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:50,960
no thought no this the way he explains that
mata haeng the sixth page I've explained is

50
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:59,550
it's so beautiful so practical okay what does
it mean no thought okay you hear about this

51
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:07,050
quite often from the Chinese literature the
mayan literature is that uh Buddha has no

52
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:13,430
thoughts and so forth they referring to the
fact that the Buddha when he's in the state

53
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:21,600
or you're in a state of Buddhahood then your
mind is free of thoughts okay what is if your

54
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:38,850
mind is free of thoughts how can you live
anyone knows how can you work

55
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,970
is that possible that you have no thoughts
in your mind at all even when you work they

56
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:50,950
have no thoughts when you eat have no thoughts
you talk you have no thoughts you create you

57
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:56,450
have no thoughts

58
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:05,510
you believe is it possible

59
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,691
yes or black

60
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:16,710
I'm it for I think it's possible because

61
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:26,970
when we drive I don't think we we have much
talk but we do drive uh properly is that why

62
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:32,520
you got re-ended by a truck like a couple
years ago

63
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:39,630
you went into a no-talk thing and boom they
hit you in the rear

64
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:47,040
were you an old hot state yeah I think I i
i don't think much when I drive that's what

65
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,520
happened you should stop it

66
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,890
anyone else what is no thought here yes green

67
00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:34,180
[Music] master I think that increase the volume

68
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:42,240
for example when we eat the food entering
our mouth we know that it is good taste it

69
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,650
tastes delicious or not but we don't follow
the thought after to attach to whether I want

70
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:59,200
it more or not so no attachment to the flavor
in that case I think this is no thought so

71
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,060
for example today at lunch you enjoy the pizza

72
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,630
did you enjoy the pizza anyone

73
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:17,980
she ate pizza she liked it

74
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,551
and describe your state of no thought

75
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:46,510
[Laughter] oh [Music]

76
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:53,010
no translation hello can you hear me

77
00:15:53,010 --> 00:16:01,930
hello Amituofo master um I realized that pizza
this time is very delicious better than many

78
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:13,820
other times however I only take one piece
i don't take the second piece that's no thought

79
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,040
and how did you decide you not to take a second
slice of pizza

80
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:41,800
yeah I have no thought at all naturally i
just stop I don't take the second piece how

81
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:48,140
many slices of pizza do you normally eat

82
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,910
yeah don't take

83
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,760
master normally too

84
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,820
so why today all sun you normally have two
slices of pizza and today only one slice of

85
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,200
pizza how do you explain that the difference

86
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:22,209
a foreign master at that time it just naturally
in my instant is that way I don't know how

87
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:31,360
to explain it but it's just natural instance
so for example uh does that mean that in the

88
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:40,420
event does it also mean that you used to love
your husband twice as much as well now you

89
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:58,600
love him 50 less naturally [Music]

90
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,270
i don't know how to compare that analogy it's
not about comparison it's about I'm trying

91
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:12,920
to get you to tell us how you did it you know
you can go from two sizes pizza to one size

92
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:19,620
visa without doing anything okay okay okay
that's what you say I'm asking you uh does

93
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:29,330
it also mean you also love your husband one
slice less

94
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:34,330
without thinking

95
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,940
okay never mind the husband okay let's talk
something more real how about your son your

96
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:46,660
precious son does that also mean that you
also can love your son 50 less without even

97
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:54,890
thinking

98
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:59,970
you think about it here while you were the
green one this question applies to you okay

99
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:05,400
which is what she's talking about all of a
sudden she says I just decide not to take

100
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,429
it and I don't have to think about it and
does it mean you two can love him less you

101
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:20,309
know naturally without even thinking I think
so he says don't don't tell him mommy [Laughter]

102
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:25,790
don't hurt me yeah you you buy into that

103
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:36,210
all right I don't know the context completely
but no the context never mind okay going back

104
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:42,170
to the orange one so how do you arrive at
it it's the same process since you don't even

105
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:48,980
have to think all of a sudden you decide I'm
going to love him less I'm going to eat less

106
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,980
how does it come about

107
00:19:49,980 --> 00:20:19,540
no answer

108
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:27,330
so that means you stop loving your husband
100 without thinking now this is a lot more

109
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,920
serious than I thought

110
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,770
without thinking you just stop

111
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:42,290
like you see an accident when you're driving
you say oh I better stop same thing you see

112
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,299
your husband I better stop

113
00:20:46,299 --> 00:21:03,640
how does that work

114
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:10,320
okay let me explain to you um never mind by
the slice of pizza and the husband that's

115
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,260
too personal let's not talk about it which
is curious that's well that's all but uh we

116
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:24,120
uh uh uh we gotta let you get off the hook
here for a while uh no thought he mean to

117
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:33,460
view all dharma with the mind undefiled by
attachment meaning as it says okay here's

118
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:39,530
what happens when you look at a slice of pizza
yes

119
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:48,530
okay and you say good pizza or bad pizza something
like that happens naturally yes we all know

120
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,850
we took a bite as oh good pizza

121
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:56,740
pizza

122
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:08,840
okay it happens naturally is that clear okay
that is still no thought is that clear your

123
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:17,320
perception good or bad desire undesirable
and desirable is natural it's still no thought

124
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
okay

125
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:27,490
it's only when after that he says

126
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:39,740
let's have some red peppers pepper flakes
anyone today I took a slight pizza and flex

127
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:49,150
what happened to bad foot legs happen to anyone
it's just me just only me huh

128
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:57,580
why do I feel so lonely I mean am I the only
one with each pizza who expects buffer flex

129
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:05,540
with my pizza

130
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,200
seriously

131
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:18,770
okay so that is what he's referring to uh
to view all things all dharmas here's mean

132
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:28,100
all things look at everything with the mind
okay the mind right there undefined my attachment

133
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:36,630
if I look at the slice of pizza and I say
good pizza bad pizza it's a fact okay the

134
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:43,970
mind is perception of the facts we condition
the field is good we condition a few is bad

135
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:51,540
that's how we train so far so good that's
how we function normally that's still no thought

136
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:59,790
okay however when the thought arises it says
uh red buffer flakes what happened to the

137
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:06,080
flakes what happened to the parmigiano cheese
what kind what kind of outfit is this yeah

138
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:14,260
eat pizza without pepper flakes without parmigiana
cheese okay what what is that called

139
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:28,080
a mind defiled by attachment to buffer flakes
or parmesan cheese is that clear then is no

140
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,720
longer no thought

141
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:38,540
so if you have a slice of pizza you say oh
it's good pizza and you eat it okay naturally

142
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:48,820
it's still no thought but when you have a
thought that arises after it says

143
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,330
i want more cheese

144
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:59,190
anyone seriously I was the only one

145
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:06,900
you guys are weird you said are you dishonest

146
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:12,870
okay uh so that is

147
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:19,500
to have thought is that clear this is distinction
here is very precise you need to be clear

148
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:26,180
about this it means that in a state of no
thought doesn't mean you're dead you still

149
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:34,970
experience flavors to experience the the you
are still able to process the facts properly

150
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:43,419
but you don't give rise to demands okay or
rejection is that clear he said this is good

151
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:51,100
pizza that's not hot that's natural a statement
of a fat this is good pizza this is bad pizza

152
00:25:51,100 --> 00:26:01,470
this needs more cheese this needing more cheese
no thought or with thoughts

153
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:09,309
they have to think [Music] you guys are weird
my god where have you been you are just too

154
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:10,309
yellow-faced

155
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:15,600
huh

156
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:26,789
okay never mind about pizza what about what
about you have some some some stir-fries

157
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:29,910
okay

158
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:37,860
and and you eat it and you say more soy sauce
okay is that we thought or without thought

159
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,980
huh

160
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,100
thought

161
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:53,390
who says thought one two three four five

162
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:58,380
no no it's not for you it's for the you know
the soy sauce people

163
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:12,480
[Laughter] you like Chinese food too oh me
too no talk because it's state of fact because

164
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:19,690
your pellets are used to a certain balance
of flavors right so the food has to be salty

165
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:25,770
enough for you otherwise you say okay this
is not salty okay it's not hot it's still

166
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:35,200
not attachment it's a it is a statement of
facts that this dish here is not salty enough

167
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:44,820
that's a statement of fact it's when you have
thank you

168
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:54,700
he's tough isn't he he doesn't get startled
that easily okay he has no thoughts

169
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:04,210
you got that so you see and you see you interact
the world okay that's a natural state of no

170
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:13,559
thoughts but when you have something like
rejection or like that is thought right he

171
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:25,000
said I would like another slice of pizza that
is thoughts because it's called thought because

172
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,240
how does the thought arise from something
called

173
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,350
greed

174
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:43,100
doesn't make sense the pizza just pizza is
good but you were greedy for more flavors

175
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:49,860
therefore he said I want more that is called
a thought

176
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,780
does it make sense to you

177
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:01,250
okay that is what it meant here in this sentence
no thought means view okay all dharma everything

178
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:08,240
with the mind that undefined by attachment
if you see you say oh it's white this is black

179
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:14,201
this is a pale face this is blackface and
so forth that's a statement of facts there's

180
00:29:14,201 --> 00:29:21,380
no defilement there is no attachment there
just a statement of facts okay but it says

181
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:29,309
i don't like you I'm out of here okay that
is uh those thoughts arise because of the

182
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:38,669
three poisons greed anger stupidity then it's
called thought so what is the engine behind

183
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:45,799
the thought arises that's what differentiate
between what's called heart versus no thought

184
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:52,169
is that clear that's a distinction that's
a definition

185
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:58,429
so do not mistake the fact of when we talk
about no thought that you don't have any thoughts

186
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:05,659
at all in your mind it's not true okay the
thought that arises from the lack of greed

187
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:10,350
anger stupidity is called no thoughts

188
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:18,730
so that's why you can still function every
day normally as long as you're not motivated

189
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:29,600
by greed anger and stupidity then you have
no thoughts

190
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:39,710
okay so attachment in other words this attachment
word here okay the attachment is formed by

191
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:49,870
greed anger and stupidity that's all is that
simple

192
00:30:49,870 --> 00:31:01,490
and the way the paycheck put it is very eloquent
very precise but it still causes

193
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:09,470
misunderstanding okay it's very precise it
says mind undefined by attachment attachment

194
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:17,210
if you take a step further attachment is created
by greed anger stability that's all does it

195
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,610
help

196
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:29,760
so when she says I have sliced visa I have
good this is good pizza and I stopped I didn't

197
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:46,840
take a second slice is that we thought or
without heart

198
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:53,760
without thought someone says without thought
no thought how about the rest of you

199
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:06,120
go ahead uh green it depends on why only take
one if she only take one because [Music] the

200
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:13,720
thoughts of great anger and stupidity that
still saw yes by definition I'm asking you

201
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,919
when she stopped this morning I should stop
this morning

202
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,620
maybe she really wanted but she's like okay
i want to lose weight I i I'm worried about

203
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:31,220
eating too much then say that I stop here
because I want to lose weight is that we thought

204
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:38,020
or without thought so we sought with heart
right we agree right I stopped here because

205
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:44,130
I'm uh overweight no no no

206
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:53,039
sorry how can we describe her never mind okay
okay so the way she described is that I didn't

207
00:32:53,039 --> 00:33:04,630
think I should stop that is exactly no top
very good applause

208
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:10,220
see that's how you function naturally you
don't have that so at mo at times you can

209
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:17,620
do that too a time you say I should stop here
okay uh and and and uh that's called no thought

210
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:24,210
however however the difference in you in those
states versus her she's that she's constantly

211
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,919
in that state when you stop is good you think
him eating something else

212
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:38,590
she just stopped is that clear okay and and
how can you tell the difference you cannot

213
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:44,789
tell that's the problem is it clear this is
what happens the Buddhists by the way the

214
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:49,860
practices get to the point where they think
they have no thoughts actually they cannot

215
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:57,690
see that the driving force behind that state
that's all themselves you know fascinating

216
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:03,679
that's why the the Buddhists even the advanced
practitioners they're mistaken to they can

217
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:10,849
be mistaken they jumped to conclusions prematurely
so it's not uncommon for people low level

218
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:18,950
they would think they have no thoughts actually
it's driven by greed anger stupidity

219
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:32,550
you see how beautiful definition is he says
the mind free from attachment caused by greed

220
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:43,320
anger stupidity between in parenthesis okay
yes black media for master then I think then

221
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:54,300
our [Music] our knowledge about Buddhism or
if we we pick up a sutra and we chant through

222
00:34:54,300 --> 00:35:04,450
it or we read through it we can be misunderstanded
because vuonim we are thinking that we have

223
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:13,310
no no false thinking but actually this this
explanation that the we are not being defiled

224
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:22,349
by by the attachment by grid anger and stability
so much more accurate yeah I added breathe

225
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:29,839
anger stability without it you're still confused

226
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:39,010
so most of us who who who try to study Buddhism
with our teacher without um real really then

227
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:45,869
we can be we can misunderstand the whole thing
absolutely her colleagues you know the co-cultivator

228
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:52,250
they have a hundred of them uh practicing
uh together and they all think themselves

229
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:57,180
having no taught and so forth but actually
uh they're all full of greed anger stupidity

230
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:03,080
how can they possibly have no thoughts they're
always fighting each other arguing out there

231
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:09,790
and so forth right so you cannot tell me they
have no no three poisons and yet they say

232
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,790
i have no thoughts

233
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:19,170
okay and that's a fallacy you don't decide
it to yourself

234
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,240
go ahead way mountain

235
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,869
master I have a question between a rising
a thought was the translation to Vietnamese

236
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:38,610
as fact or it just say is there a difference
between the two sorry

237
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:42,920
i have a question in regards to the English
to Vietnamese translation when we say the

238
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:50,609
thought arise in Vietnamese does it mean that
e or is mean

239
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:56,890
where the thought arises

240
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:04,500
um I'm trying to translate to the word that
we have a thought what does that mean in English

241
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,550
yes when we have a thought where the thought
when you're trying to explain that does it

242
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:19,730
mean in Vietnamese mean papi or it means kind
it means neim koi

243
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:24,550
thank you master okay

244
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:31,470
these are important distinctions because there's
certain jargon in Buddhism very precise unless

245
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:38,210
you know what you're doing you will be mistaken
very easy to translate improperly just like

246
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:43,200
this morning when I explained to you about
the song enlightenment the translation to

247
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:54,490
English is incorrect and that causes problems
serious problems okay [Music]

248
00:37:54,490 --> 00:38:01,960
that's okay let them be don't worry don't
worry let that don't be it's okay uh it's

249
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:12,160
uh it's us too we need to bear with it and
uh we don't let him eat tonight that's all

250
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:20,380
it's okay don't worry let them be let them
play it's okay because because if it bothers

251
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:26,320
you what is that called we thought

252
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:36,400
okay we have to pretend we have no thoughts

253
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:45,859
okay uh next uh is it clear does it help okay
it is so commonplace for the Buddhist disciples

254
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:53,910
the Buddhist researchers and to understand
what it means by no thought because it is

255
00:38:53,910 --> 00:39:01,560
very fairly easy to misunderstand this process
why because they had they haven't got there

256
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:07,070
yet they only read up on things they haven't
got to the state of no thought that's why

257
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:13,140
they don't know what they're talking about
someone just tell you you reached northart

258
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:18,040
then ah that's no thought that's when you
know yourself but others still don't know

259
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:24,450
others have still have no clues okay now you're
saying why some occasionally I said oh you

260
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:34,620
you are there because because then then you
know I'm telling you that your state is real

261
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:41,210
it's accurate not your imagination until that
happens until someone tells you you should

262
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:47,240
not believe yourself period way mountain

263
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:53,579
master thank you um I'm used to thinking a
lot about pizza but what's a good example

264
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:57,160
of a thought of stupidity thought of stupidity

265
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:12,930
uh I'm sorry I can't think of anything stupid
someone help me out daniel give me some example

266
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:20,900
star stupidity

267
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,140
very good the guy is learning very fast

268
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:29,320
anyone else would like to tell me an example
of thought of stupidity

269
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:55,150
you could say I have no more stability

270
00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:05,690
[Music]

271
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:10,700
master I saw that these people are greedy
for gambling there there's a verse in Vietnamese

272
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:18,650
saying that the um gambling is the uncle of
the poor so the people who doesn't believe

273
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:23,730
they just think that these poor people is
their own problem so they just keep playing

274
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:30,400
in the end they ended up losing everything
so I think that is the example of stupidity

275
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,500
okay exactly yeah that's correct especially
the people who are addicted to the gambling

276
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:43,359
you know they cannot help themselves okay
it's true it's very good very good example

277
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:56,200
excellent so thoughts thoughts stupidity are
they in general the thoughts that are

278
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:03,359
for a general thumb for your reference a thought
for example that denies the connection between

279
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,160
cause and effect

280
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,160
that's stupidity

281
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,910
for example you say

282
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:24,230
if I steal from someone and she doesn't know
it's no harm is that correct that's called

283
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:33,510
thought or stupidity just because you're not
caught doesn't mean it's okay and and you

284
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:39,430
may be laughing but this is how people the
world operate sounds familiar we steal from

285
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:44,339
the companies we steal from our friends it's
still our own families it's still from our

286
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:51,500
acquaintances as long as you're not caught
it's not harm done right that's so wrong that

287
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:58,410
very stupid behavior

288
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:04,630
and you don't need to be caught you don't
need to be judged uh the fact that that you

289
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:12,400
steal when you teach someone in the future
you have to pay it back it's a matter of time

290
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:19,370
you cannot avoid it no one can even Buddhas
cannot avoid it

291
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:28,490
is that clear it's for everyone so such thoughts
are really really stupid and yet and yet that's

292
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:34,380
i use how I use the function I use the thing
that you know I can do anything I please and

293
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:43,220
it's law I'm not caught what's the big deal
okay that sheer stupidity

294
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,220
okay

295
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:54,540
you see you see and that's that's why that's
why we are exercising not having thoughts

296
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:03,849
stupidity okay by bearing with all the kids
screaming and throwing things at you

297
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,930
because you have no attachments right

298
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:13,250
you can do that I don't throw my microphone

299
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:21,720
okay

300
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:28,140
okay and last last week we talked about eyes
contemplate sound forms outside there's nothing

301
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:35,099
inside and we always talk about ears here
the dusts and phenomena mine do not know okay

302
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:40,710
so we talked about that extensively we're
going to skip that the next the fast the last

303
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:49,940
sentence the function pervades all places
but is nowhere attached meaning what okay

304
00:44:49,940 --> 00:45:00,710
function here refers to what pervades all
places

305
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:05,690
function here means

306
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:12,720
whatever you do to do something is called
function why is it called function function

307
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:23,650
of your nature your nature is going to do
something okay and that's called function

308
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:31,040
function is to do is utilized for something
nature decides to eat nature decides to sleep

309
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:38,339
the nature decides to go to work okay that's
called function the function of the nature

310
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:46,810
is to produce for eight hours a day at work
okay is that clear that's a function function

311
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:57,930
of yours being of your self your function
right now is to sit and listen that's a function

312
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:04,710
your nature yes the function of the kids is
to run around make noises and play because

313
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:17,180
they're kids okay our function as adult is
to bear with it okay and not complain

314
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:22,920
all right now so the function pervades all
places meaning that you do that everywhere

315
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:38,150
but it is nowhere attached and and yet you
can be like that without depending on anything

316
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:44,950
for example people say I can bear with the
noise and bear the kids running around as

317
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:57,050
long as master uh allows it sound familiar
okay is that is that considered nowhere attached

318
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:03,720
the functions I would put up with the noise
i would not flinch okay I will not complain

319
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:13,970
i will not get afflicted as long as master
tolerates it master says it's okay okay does

320
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:21,230
that mean in that state there you are nowhere
attached no it doesn't because you are attached

321
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:28,870
to the fact that I allow it if I didn't allow
you say sit down

322
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:35,359
right so I'm your attachment and say I don't
know but if he says okay the voice okay so

323
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,250
this funky here that's why I'm training you
that you can be here with without me the kids

324
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:50,150
can run around make noises and you say okay
make noises see if I care is that clear so

325
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:59,200
so what is the implication that when you think
about it why do people put on facades why

326
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:11,790
do people pretend because of attachments right
i said Vietnamese example they said I'm not

327
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:18,430
going to lose face I'm not you know I'm above
this sounds familiar I'm going to keep my

328
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:31,510
cool and that is attachment two faces yes

329
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:38,290
so prashia he have wisdom yeah you don't make
pretenses you don't pretend at all there's

330
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:45,380
no need to pretend does it make sense so whatever
you do the function pervades all places whatever

331
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:55,230
you decide to do okay it's not based on pretending
or put on a facade or trying to look good

332
00:48:55,230 --> 00:49:06,040
avoiding looking back and so forth okay no
need for all those

333
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:12,099
or for monks and nuns we do this so that we
look impressive and people give us more money

334
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:21,300
more donations sounds familiar okay yeah as
soon as you leave I will put my feet up and

335
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,320
on the table and oh my god such a long day

336
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:34,690
oh I'm glad now I can relax don't need to
pretend to look you know and sit in full loaders

337
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:41,690
and look so adorned and cool so tiring

338
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:45,670
to be like that

339
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:54,520
okay and so so that's why that's why uh that's
why when you understand this process you don't

340
00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:00,440
need to put on facades you don't need to judge
people actually you feel sorry for the people

341
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,420
who put on facades don't judge them because
they are

342
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:14,430
latent with attachments they have so many
attachments they need to feel compelled to

343
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:15,819
put on facades

344
00:50:15,819 --> 00:50:20,420
okay they they are so

345
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:32,710
seeking people's approval it's sad it's a
set state of mind

346
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:38,310
you know in particular and I'm I admit to
you particular verse monks and nuns we full

347
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:44,320
pray to that we need to put our facade for
you I need to look magnanimous generous and

348
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:51,780
cool and you know I'm always unflustered and
always speak the nice and kind words and smile

349
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,400
to you oh how are you today I'm so glad you're
here

350
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:11,180
okay yeah and uh and and we are guilty of
that we're guilty of the fact that that we

351
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:17,080
saw especially amongst the nuns we are so
worried about how we are perceived that we

352
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:25,829
need to go cultivate this image of being magnanimous
and kind and compassionate and so forth so

353
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:35,640
we cease to be real okay and you like that
you're doing a disservice to Buddhism you

354
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:42,869
doing this service to your followers I feel

355
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:53,340
[Music] okay for the sake of getting more
donations okay so it's funny because uh because

356
00:51:53,340 --> 00:52:00,430
i have been training a lot of monks and nuns
and now and we're going to in the second phase

357
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:05,410
where I asked them to stand up and say you
know the old monk here should be the front

358
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:11,970
man for northern California you know he'll
uh people know to come come to the temple

359
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:21,060
and see him in the face with the uh with the
temples here and so forth and and and so people

360
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:26,819
ask him can I take your photo to attach a
photo to dharma tertiary temple to go for

361
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:44,910
his temple he says no leave me alone is that
note heart or with heart

362
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:48,319
hmm

363
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:55,040
we thought right because I don't want to take
a photo I don't want my photo taken because

364
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:04,619
I'd only be known right okay on the surface
is a good thing because they've been trained

365
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:12,420
too well either they're lazy like me or they
decided they are not going to look for fame

366
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:21,440
and profit which is a good thing okay so but
why do I say it's we thought

367
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:33,560
um

368
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:51,849
Amituofo master I think that it is still a thought
that say I don't want this and this is the

369
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:56,900
thought of rejection there's still it is still
a thought

370
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:05,430
that's right he says I don't want recognition
i don't want attention to myself okay that

371
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:16,230
thought there okay it's a thought because
again because it goes against what

372
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:27,819
my instruction

373
00:54:27,819 --> 00:54:34,540
basically he says I may agree with master
i may respect him but I'm not looking for

374
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:44,250
fame a prophet okay whereas my instructions
go and be a representative he says no I'm

375
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:48,369
gonna do it because I'm not like that

376
00:54:48,369 --> 00:55:00,190
okay yeah so it's called it's called attachment
to the dharma is that clear yes they understand

377
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:05,730
they're not attached to fame they're not attached
to profit okay it's strong to be attached

378
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:14,550
to fame it's wrong to be attached to profit
okay that is correct okay however if I say

379
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:23,640
it's okay and you disagree with me then you're
attaching to the concepts

380
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:29,420
you understand the subtlety in Buddhism is
called attachment to the dharma the you attach

381
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:37,250
the concept of no fame no prophet seeking
that's still concept and he's attached to

382
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,950
it if he refuses

383
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:46,750
doesn't make sense this is a common place
it's a very subtle attachment that unless

384
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:50,410
i pointed out to him he would not be able
to see it

385
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:53,160
he's very subtle it's called

386
00:55:53,160 --> 00:56:02,700
attachment to the dharma far tree

387
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:10,100
and that's what you are have a problem you
don't even know this is your attachment you

388
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,330
don't get it yet

389
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:21,950
so each level you have your attachments

390
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:30,540
okay so this function here meaning that you're
able to be like this to work or to be yourself

391
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:41,520
uh everywhere anywhere in the u.s in canada
in the pure land and so forth but is nowhere

392
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:49,829
attached that's called practice so when you
have prajna wisdom you can work and behave

393
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:59,220
and live normally and it's free from any attachments
that's the beauty of prajna wisdom you can

394
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:04,800
do anything and yet you're not attached at
all

395
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,800
it's called

396
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:13,450
total freedom

397
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:15,849
okay and that's practical that's prajna wisdom

398
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:24,770
and that is again I stress for all of you
who are new here this fashion wisdom here

399
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:31,819
you have it you just don't know how to use
it that's all and the nature of the teaching

400
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:42,040
is that we need first to remind you it's yours
it's nothing that you need to develop or build

401
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:50,890
or invent or create it's inside you bury deep
inside of you that's all I need to dig and

402
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:59,940
dick or clean and wipe it off until you can
see it then say oh that's mine then you can

403
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:06,200
use it is it clear it's not something new
at all it's not anything new it's something

404
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:16,480
you always have and you just need to learn
how to see it so that you can use it you yourself

405
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:27,050
have to see whether I see it or not is your
irrelevant you have to see yourself

406
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:32,359
is that clear you all have it by way I need
to emphasize it it's nothing new to you you

407
00:58:32,359 --> 00:58:40,369
have it you just don't know where it is in
a you know manner of speaking he just don't

408
00:58:40,369 --> 00:59:17,440
know where it is that's all he is like an
old person I don't know I put my car keys

409
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:24,140
master amito for master I remember master
xinhua has a saying that everything is okay

410
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:31,609
is it because he has attained the function
um function is at ease that is why he's saying

411
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:34,920
this

412
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:41,942
that's a state of mind that I cannot explain
to you if I say yes or no it doesn't mean

413
00:59:41,942 --> 00:59:49,349
anything to you what we try to do what I try
to do for you is for you to help you [Music]

414
00:59:49,349 --> 00:59:55,490
enter the state whether I say yes or no to
you just okay

415
00:59:55,490 --> 01:00:06,380
just like to use like okay so the pizza uh
tastes good but you don't really cannot express

416
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:13,579
more than that and that's the

417
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:19,300
nature of Buddhist teachings the Buddhist
teaching is that somehow bring you there instruction

418
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:25,369
bring you therefore you experience it experience
a state of no thoughts the state of freedom

419
01:00:25,369 --> 01:00:34,049
from depression freedom from from attachment
freedom from afflictions okay you have to

420
01:00:34,049 --> 01:00:42,450
answer yourself otherwise it's no way to explain
it to you no way you have to experience it

421
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:50,190
so Buddhist things Buddhist uh in Buddhism
the emphasis has always been since when the

422
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:57,700
Buddha first came to our world and started
teaching his disciples the objective has always

423
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:05,569
been to tell you what you ought to do in order
to experience that

424
01:01:05,569 --> 01:01:12,349
that state called first iana the state called
fifth samadhi that state called fourth stage

425
01:01:12,349 --> 01:01:18,400
aha a state called first ground bodhisattva
it's not meant to this to be described to

426
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:26,500
you it's meant for you to get there okay that's
our job to bring you there okay and when you're

427
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:33,490
there okay the Buddha's instruction the Buddha's
description what it is will make sense to

428
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:39,100
you then until that happens there's no point
telling you about it because you don't know

429
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:44,349
anything you don't understand it you can yeah
the words make sense to you but it's not about

430
01:01:44,349 --> 01:02:04,829
words it's about whether you can do it or
not

431
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:14,470
that's why masha shinhoa my late Chinese teacher
is the only monk I know who stressed that

432
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:21,520
he stressed giving us instructions how to
be there to get there instead of giving us

433
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:27,619
knowledge on what it's about he says you know
the the monks who don't know they read from

434
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:33,570
the books and they said okay the production
is this is that it's no thought the function

435
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:40,690
pervades all places there is nowhere attached
it's from the the text okay is it obvious

436
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:46,900
isn't it and they you ask them what is no
target well that's what this is what the Buddha

437
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:53,569
says north heart is uh look at all dharma
with uh my undefined attachment what's not

438
01:02:53,569 --> 01:03:00,650
clear to you and this happens everywhere all
places and uh but it's nowhere attached what's

439
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:06,400
not clear to you is it's it's great English
to me

440
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:14,849
and that's what happens to Buddhism nowadays
amongst the nuns especially I met a lot of

441
01:03:14,849 --> 01:03:24,059
bontes from sri lanka from from thailand so
forth and and they they keep on and especially

442
01:03:24,059 --> 01:03:29,849
professors they keep on bringing up these
words from sutras when I look at them so you

443
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:37,730
don't even know what you're talking about

444
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:42,980
and that's why that's what was the comment
we made earlier is very important it sounds

445
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:51,290
casual but it's very important in that all
these sutras here are the general principles

446
01:03:51,290 --> 01:04:00,900
to describe to you that state but I cannot
describe everything because you won't be able

447
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:06,840
to understand everything therefore we explain
to you this state there like in this slide

448
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:14,240
198 and then people like marsha shinhua will
have to come and teach you how to cross your

449
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:23,240
legs how to meditate how to how to listen
to suture lectures and how to uh be a nicer

450
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:32,610
person a kind of person so forth until you're
able to experience it yourself

451
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:41,210
it's not meant for you to understand you have
to experience it and so the instructions from

452
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:46,410
the monks and nuns are designed to push you
and push you and push you and push you until

453
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:50,680
you get there

454
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:55,930
so each monk and none has their own ways of
pushing you and masha xinhua one of the best

455
01:04:55,930 --> 01:05:09,790
I've seen only surpassed by this sixth major
in my personal experience not so

456
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:17,319
okay yeah questions or comments

457
01:05:17,319 --> 01:05:24,980
okay tool one that is a prasha samadhi in
freedom and liberation and is called the practice

458
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:25,980
of no thought

459
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:30,000
borders

460
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:41,640
okay very good so he says he went through
a lot of explanation he says this brazilian

461
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:49,930
here is it's brazilian or your transcendental
wisdom is a form of samadhi in other words

462
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:58,299
when you enter this project somebody your
branch wisdom is operational naturally you

463
01:05:58,299 --> 01:06:06,740
don't have to do things so that's what happened
to these advanced being they can enter this

464
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:16,460
rashnya samadhi and naturally they'll the
wisdom comes to the fore that's all it functions

465
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:26,210
with how anywhere attached okay and that's
freedom uh it's not freedom but self mastery

466
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:34,690
okay can you change it the English translation
is like made a long time ago and they didn't

467
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:42,660
quite have the vocabulary that we agreed to
nowadays suicide is not it's not freedom okay

468
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:50,250
suicide here is called self-mastery at ease
it has nothing to do with freedom freedom

469
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:55,390
is American

470
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:59,430
or

471
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:04,720
Chinese like to think it's freedom but actually
it's American it's a Chinese it's suicide

472
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:14,430
okay Chinese self-mastery it's not freedom
American is freedom what about hispanics what

473
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:15,430
is your

474
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:26,819
danielle is too busy translating

475
01:07:26,819 --> 01:07:37,660
okay so it's self-mastery it's called cell
mastery because you are under no influence

476
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:38,770
outside influence

477
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:49,590
okay

478
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:54,630
okay very good

479
01:07:54,630 --> 01:08:03,710
when you are in this state of mind which by
the way it's something that you can flip at

480
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:13,660
this stage here you can flip into a confused
state like us and you flip it and go into

481
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:20,870
practice just like that

482
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:27,469
what about Buddhas do they flip no Buddha
is always in pressure that's why they call

483
01:08:27,469 --> 01:08:35,830
Buddhas we're not Buddhas that's why we're
not that's who we are okay you can click i

484
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:46,120
I'm always there forget it wishful thinking
we are different Buddhas in that we cannot

485
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:50,810
always be there we because

486
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:54,390
karmic retribution

487
01:08:54,390 --> 01:09:02,449
okay when we're not there we suffer we're
miserable we are making mistakes when you

488
01:09:02,449 --> 01:09:09,040
like the Buddha you stop making mistakes you
stop creating offenses okay if you're not

489
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:18,040
Buddhas you will continue to create offenses
you can't help it that's who we are yes you're

490
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:23,690
very special but you create offenses left
and right

491
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:30,580
okay so you're on this the end of this rashima
but remember these people these like the bodhisattvas

492
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:37,870
they can flip the switch just like that and
we while we cannot we don't have that ability

493
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:45,730
they can they can flip once a moment they
confuse flip they enter the sparse you think

494
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:55,640
it's kind of cool okay and when you're there
you're there then you have self-mastery so

495
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:04,120
mastery refers to the fact that you [Music]
inside you at peace okay

496
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:11,770
you're at peace with yourself you don't think
yourself as short if someone calls you shorty

497
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:18,850
you say yeah

498
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:22,040
someone bullies you is it okay

499
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:32,850
you're not affected okay so inside cell mastery
has two parts one part is internally you are

500
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:42,850
you are totally cool unafflicted okay and
outside the outside part self mastery is that

501
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:49,580
you are at ease everywhere you are no matter
what happens an earthquake happens as a fire

502
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:57,630
happens too hot anyone okay you still

503
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:09,219
that's for self-mastery no matter what happens
outside you as cool as a cucumber

504
01:11:09,219 --> 01:11:18,929
okay how about liberation liberation refers
to the fact that what we we like to deny for

505
01:11:18,929 --> 01:11:29,679
us ordinary people we deny what what do we
deny what what kind of denial are we practicing

506
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:30,679
anyone

507
01:11:30,679 --> 01:11:40,020
what are we denying

508
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:55,270
this is a biggie you don't see this are you
in trouble

509
01:11:55,270 --> 01:12:02,010
malcolm what are you denying

510
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:06,219
the existence of god existence of myself

511
01:12:06,219 --> 01:12:08,469
yourself

512
01:12:08,469 --> 01:12:20,060
he doesn't know what he's talking about he's
in denial anyone else what are you denying

513
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:35,290
anyone this is so fundamental yes sir

514
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:42,750
use sign language black

515
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:53,590
in denial of we are in a confused state we
have [Music] thoughts of

516
01:12:53,590 --> 01:13:04,179
greed and anger and stupidity okay we deny
this is what happens to us we deny that we

517
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:08,739
are suffering

518
01:13:08,739 --> 01:13:14,770
deep down in our psyche and say I'm not suffering
I'm happy and in hell it's bad but I still

519
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:20,950
happy my life I love my wife

520
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:27,910
and of course the wife don't believe it ask
them and say no he doesn't don't I don't believe

521
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:32,840
him you shouldn't either

522
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:38,140
no

523
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:45,010
okay so uh your denial that we are suffering
therefore uh when you just enter this we have

524
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:57,750
this practice samadhi you are liberated from
your own suffering your own misery

525
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:03,510
okay so for example let's talk about something
real specific real practical let's say you

526
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:13,989
have depression anyone have depression daniel
okay anyone else just me and daniel okay a

527
01:14:13,989 --> 01:14:21,739
few people oh it turns out a lot more than
people would like to admit they're all denial

528
01:14:21,739 --> 01:14:28,610
those who didn't raise their hands are all
practicing denial okay

529
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:37,250
so um [Music] so here's what happens let me
let let me tell you this so that you understand

530
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:46,400
uh the connection between that and and the
spiritual practice okay let's say you're depressed

531
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:51,280
okay never mind don't raise your hands I don't
don't bother I know you're depressed please

532
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:59,280
please but experience you you okay okay so
let's say you're depressed okay yeah you you're

533
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:06,620
feeling depressed what can you do nothing
right not much you can do it's all I'm not

534
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:15,739
feel good I don't feel good okay if you have
disprajna wisdom you realize you're depressed

535
01:15:15,739 --> 01:15:22,540
what happens flip no more depression instantaneously

536
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:32,140
that's called liberation from depression

537
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:39,880
sounds good wouldn't that be cool to be able
to do john can train you to do that that's

538
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:48,500
a great news okay but then that woman there
says but I want money right now

539
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:56,080
okay no promises I heard too many promises
from my husband already

540
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:04,429
okay so can you give me something real liberation
okay

541
01:16:04,429 --> 01:16:10,260
actually occurs at many many levels not just
at practice level at low levels you liberate

542
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:18,640
from certain types of depression as you improve
the next level there you are even less inclined

543
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:24,160
to be depressed about certain things your
wife leaves you next

544
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:36,600
that's liberation from your wife

545
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:44,690
and the girls are giggling and saying yeah
good luck [Laughter] wishful thinking

546
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:52,100
okay so that's what happens when you enter
when you improve in Chan meditation your

547
01:16:52,100 --> 01:17:02,190
depression becomes more and more manageable

548
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:07,960
so you don't need to be all they have all
the way to the level of creative wisdom where

549
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:15,140
all depression stopped 100 but as you improve
in your meditation practice your depression

550
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:22,159
gets lighter and lighter and lighter and lighter
and lighter until zero so there's a progression

551
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:30,880
naturally there's hope think about it that's
a great news without any medication without

552
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:36,370
any counseling it's like dui do it yourself
type of treatment

553
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:51,100
they don't have applause signs here do they

554
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:56,620
too late yeah

555
01:17:56,620 --> 01:18:02,950
it's called the practice of no thought okay
and that's that's what this thing is so the

556
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:07,410
reason I'm telling you is that there actually
is a lot of hope for many of you are suffering

557
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:15,100
all sorts of mental illnesses in particular
okay this is the solution this is the the

558
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:20,790
cure for them all meditation

559
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:30,489
for mental illnesses yeah cool and that's
the only to fix them the only way to fix them

560
01:18:30,489 --> 01:18:37,409
is through meditation not with chemicals with
counseling because counseling is on and off

561
01:18:37,409 --> 01:18:42,659
you cannot turn it off whereas meditation
you can turn it off by entering into somali

562
01:18:42,659 --> 01:18:47,659
you turn up a certain pain and suffering and
then next level of somali even more even less

563
01:18:47,659 --> 01:18:57,350
pain and suffering until zero pain and suffering
whatsoever

564
01:18:57,350 --> 01:19:03,880
that's the big picture the clarity of mind
comes from not being affected by your own

565
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:07,250
pain and suffering

566
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:11,590
we confused because we can't handle it

567
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:17,909
it behaves this

568
01:19:17,909 --> 01:19:18,909
way mount

569
01:19:18,909 --> 01:19:28,150
master uh what about the sense of guilt i
was recently attacked two times for this problem

570
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:33,480
was it a depression or

571
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:41,120
something what at what level can we be able
to deal with this issue better could you repeat

572
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:45,370
the question please

573
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:56,480
um sense of guilt it is a kind of depression
at what level can we deal with it better

574
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:03,250
the sense of cue guilty

575
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:05,910
I'm torturing her and tormenting her

576
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:13,260
so a sense of cue

577
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:29,980
yeah being cute yeah they're cute and I looked
up google cute uh I cannot find it

578
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:35,520
so the question is the acute is that depression
or something else right

579
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:45,449
yes and at what level can we deal with it
better what level can you do with it better

580
01:20:45,449 --> 01:20:48,350
and go into prajna samadhi and you can
deal with zero guilt

581
01:20:48,350 --> 01:21:07,830
below below that you always have little guilt
which is very healthy for you

582
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:19,010
how else are we going to control you

583
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:21,740
and you expect me to teach you how to be free
from out control

584
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:34,300
ah you find out it's amazing these people
tell me when I'm gonna happen they're not

585
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:41,820
excited at all about the fact they can be
eventually free of guilt or cue but they said

586
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:49,250
tell me when and what level are we talking
about and instead of saying I want to go there

587
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:52,130
i want to get there no they say tell me where

588
01:21:52,130 --> 01:22:04,310
where I can handle it

589
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:11,699
you understand you always want to know instead
of getting so excited that tell me what to

590
01:22:11,699 --> 01:22:20,889
do how do I get there you say uh where is
that level

591
01:22:20,889 --> 01:22:30,429
you are so worldly okay next two or three
not thinking of the hundred things and constantly

592
01:22:30,429 --> 01:22:50,739
causing your thought to be cut off is called
dharma bondage and is an extremist view

593
01:22:50,739 --> 01:22:58,350
okay two or four oh this is juicy I'm gonna
have a good time now are you are you all set

594
01:22:58,350 --> 01:23:08,000
are you ready now to be tormented yeah yeah
yeah okay not thinking 100 things okay okay

595
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:16,070
remember we he just explained about no thoughts
right you look at things and and and and there's

596
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:23,270
no thoughts that arises at all now he says
he specifically says not thinking a hundred

597
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:31,870
things and constantly causing a thought to
be cut off is called dharma bondage

598
01:23:31,870 --> 01:23:41,210
what does it mean that is an extremist view
what does it mean it is very very critical

599
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:48,310
for you to understand this and this is the
difference between Buddhist wisdom and ordinary

600
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,310
people

601
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:55,340
if you don't understand this that's ordinary
people you can call yourself Buddhist disciples

602
01:23:55,340 --> 01:24:01,679
you can sell bodhisattvas and so forth okay
you still

603
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:07,280
or not

604
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,940
what is it

605
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:17,239
anyone can can you almost explain to us can
massachee explain this to us to and his uh

606
01:24:17,239 --> 01:24:25,590
Korean followers let's give the Korean a chance
uh let's give uh uh light blue thank you

607
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:39,699
foreign

608
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:53,810
[Music]

609
01:24:53,810 --> 01:25:18,130
if the thought make us attach expect that
we don't want it to attach to the freedom

610
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:25,150
um to the liberation of the thought itself
doesn't mean that you are being bondaged you

611
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:30,760
are bound by the thought of yourself instead
when the thought arise you don't get afflicted

612
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:39,320
because of that thought then that is freedom
from the dharma bondage if you are still expect

613
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:45,719
the thought to be suppressed or cut off the
thought that it won't uh afflicting us then

614
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:55,270
you're still being bound by the thought of
yourself

615
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:58,610
massive

616
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:11,360
he's gonna say I agree

617
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:19,929
we arbits hang together we stand together

618
01:26:19,929 --> 01:26:21,219
the brotherhood of habits

619
01:26:21,219 --> 01:26:33,850
what's that let me talk about that now what
do you say

620
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:41,060
i don't have any talk about that now

621
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:49,960
okay god these guys there's just so many tricks
i did a [ __ ] don't believe him okay he

622
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:56,540
has to think you know the proof is that i
don't have any thought about it it should

623
01:26:56,540 --> 01:27:01,600
come out right away it's fake

624
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:10,010
jumi is it clear you saw him right you watch
him he said no I don't have to thought about

625
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:11,010
it

626
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:49,010
he's cheating okay don't believe him yes orange
here I hear the [ __ ] yesterday and today's

627
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:52,750
uh

628
01:27:52,750 --> 01:28:07,420
amit of a master um back in the day I know
that there's a group of cultivations they

629
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:18,120
specialize in um uh non uh sad renouncing
the false thought and every time the false

630
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:25,139
start arrives they just keep renouncing the
thoughts and I think it creating a discrimination

631
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:32,800
is that they trying to look for the uh true
they're trying to look for the truth and they

632
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:39,080
keep renouncing the false thought so I think
that they're still having an attachment endowment

633
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:45,270
bondage about that because they keep continuing
continuing renouncing the false thought okay

634
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:53,870
very good you see I have to ask you because
I'm really baffled why the master shanghai

635
01:28:53,870 --> 01:29:00,750
disciples didn't ask him at all his explanation
is one of the best in the marketplace in the

636
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:07,390
world for this sutra but the sutra is very
very precise it's very very good it is so

637
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:13,639
helpful for the cultivation I don't know why
they didn't ask for details what is meant

638
01:29:13,639 --> 01:29:21,739
here and the proof is that he cannot explain
masters he pretended not to understand this

639
01:29:21,739 --> 01:29:29,230
woman here uh is complaining and so forth
okay

640
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:36,640
but what he's saying is here's what he's talking
about and this is a proof to you that the

641
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:42,159
Buddha talked about these big principles that
very few people understand then the pay charts

642
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:46,600
came and said okay this is what he meant and
then this is what the sixth wage trial said

643
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:56,120
and still with this my proof to you is that
now you get it right you see Buddha's level

644
01:29:56,120 --> 01:30:00,180
we don't get it of course it's a Buddhist
level and the sixth paycheck says I'm here

645
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:08,449
to explain things to you and we still don't
get it

646
01:30:08,449 --> 01:30:17,310
now we're talking about low level okay let
me explain to you here's what happens to you

647
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:22,920
and the reason they didn't ask because they
don't know this is happening the undercurrent

648
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:29,620
happening to you and you don't realize it
is that clear okay unless you know exactly

649
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:37,120
what is the trigger of all these things happening
you will not be able to fix it agree you don't

650
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:41,770
know if you don't know the cause of all these
problems you have how are you going to fix

651
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:42,770
your problems

652
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:50,740
oop sorry time is up

653
01:30:50,740 --> 01:31:08,620
okay okay okay I will not taught her to torture
you anymore okay not thinking 100 things and

654
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:13,619
constantly causing your thought to be cut
off it's called diamond bondage he's referring

655
01:31:13,619 --> 01:31:17,670
this fact that people like her okay uh

656
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:28,050
like him sometimes like master Z sometimes
here's what happens to them okay they know

657
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:35,380
they're not supposed to have thoughts but
they keep on rising so what happened is that

658
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:42,199
i have ability to cut them off I've been trained
to cut them off she can cut them off he could

659
01:31:42,199 --> 01:31:53,230
cut him off the fake monk in Korea can cut
them off okay they can't they develop an ability

660
01:31:53,230 --> 01:31:54,230
already

661
01:31:54,230 --> 01:32:02,340
they've been trained it's not about you anymore
I'm talking about a high level okay that they

662
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:08,659
they they can cut off these thoughts okay
at will

663
01:32:08,659 --> 01:32:15,100
he can do better than she can for example
okay and mass is even better so what happened

664
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:19,810
is they can cut them off and what happened
is that when they realize they have these

665
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:26,179
thoughts arise they cut them off then the
great master says it's called dharma bondage

666
01:32:26,179 --> 01:32:31,239
so they them piss themselves and say oh oops
I'm not supposed to be attached to this I'm

667
01:32:31,239 --> 01:32:38,429
not supposed to have this thought thought
be gone done and next time it happens again

668
01:32:38,429 --> 01:32:44,010
chop it again so what are they doing they

669
01:32:44,010 --> 01:32:48,489
trimming the trees like the old monk does
every now and then he goes to the side here

670
01:32:48,489 --> 01:32:52,700
and trim the trees in front of the stop sign
otherwise the city gives us a ticket

671
01:32:52,700 --> 01:33:04,380
and you think it's funny but that's what we
do you see it's very practical if it's not

672
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:11,550
desirable trim it off right if the thought
is not desirable trim it off

673
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:22,560
what's wrong with that it's called dharma
bondage beautiful

674
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:28,909
I'm helping you appreciate that don't think
you understand everything there's many levels

675
01:33:28,909 --> 01:33:33,940
of understanding these dharmas

676
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:40,090
so unless you practice unless you have people
like him and like the one in Korea and so

677
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:47,850
forth I would not bother explaining this to
you

678
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:54,720
okay so it's called dharma bondage it's an
extremist view meaning they are subject to

679
01:33:54,720 --> 01:34:00,150
it as well and they don't realize it and the
master master HuiNeng the sixth wave track says

680
01:34:00,150 --> 01:34:06,270
boy are you in trouble you have extremist
views and you don't even know and you hide

681
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:18,909
it behind your monk's frock

682
01:34:18,909 --> 01:34:24,830
that's what happens when you realize in principle
you're not supposed to have thoughts those

683
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:29,620
sides are thoughts and these people are trained
to cut them off so they say that keep on cutting

684
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:35,010
you know cut cutting my cut and cutting off
and the sixth patriarch says it's wrong to

685
01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:42,830
do that it's called dharma bondage it's called
extremist view just because you know the thoughts

686
01:34:42,830 --> 01:34:51,010
are are not supposed to happen that happen
you cut them off it's still wrong it should

687
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:59,150
be a temporary fix not a long-term fix if
you don't fix it then it's called dharma bondage

688
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:06,450
you why is it called dharma bondage you are
bound by cutting off thoughts

689
01:35:06,450 --> 01:35:21,730
you know fascinating they think is they supposed
to do that

690
01:35:21,730 --> 01:35:27,719
they know they're supposed to do that and
they keep on doing that and they are dead

691
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:34,830
in the tracks this is the only thing that
hurts them the master says I don't care you

692
01:35:34,830 --> 01:35:39,350
got a mock good for you but what it does is
that yes it frees you it also

693
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:51,860
bind you put you in shackles

694
01:35:51,860 --> 01:36:00,040
so what do you want do you want me to train
them people you to tell people hey I have

695
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:13,030
no thoughts sure I i swear to you okay as
soon as the thought arises nice pizza [Music]

696
01:36:13,030 --> 01:36:17,790
[Laughter]

697
01:36:17,790 --> 01:36:36,350
[Music] that's called dharma bondage

698
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:41,540
is it clear to you and life unless I explain
it to you you wouldn't know what I'm talking

699
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:45,120
about nor do they

700
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:55,719
that's folks this is how precise we are when
we look at your mind how it functions we know

701
01:36:55,719 --> 01:37:03,739
that's what happens he knows what happens
in a fantastic name a psychologist named a

702
01:37:03,739 --> 01:37:14,820
neural uh whatever researcher who can describe
this is this level of details they have graphs

703
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:19,449
they have mri scans they have colors they
have red red blue and all sorts but you know

704
01:37:19,449 --> 01:37:27,900
hues of one billion different uh hues but
they lack this kind of accuracy

705
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:34,380
because unless you know what really is happening
inside your little head

706
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:51,490
you'll never be able to fix it

707
01:37:51,490 --> 01:37:58,350
questions comments yes even microphone move
closer

708
01:37:58,350 --> 01:38:07,860
uh I made it for master so so this is what
he does is I said move closer it cuts off

709
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:14,150
that thought no I ain't moving closer

710
01:38:14,150 --> 01:38:23,869
yes I mean for master so so in real life uh
as well as in the um meditation hall the when

711
01:38:23,869 --> 01:38:33,119
foss come up we just ignore it or just let
it be we don't need to do anything but from

712
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:41,690
the teaching from exactly

713
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:47,820
so when I first started teaching I learned
meditation learning meditation one of the

714
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:53,980
big disciples masha sheikhoun says as taught
by the Chinese China as well is that when

715
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:59,060
the thought arises use of our trustworth and
drop off nip it okay much sure even thought

716
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:04,220
that as well they all they all repeat the
same thing at the Chinese paycheck including

717
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:10,870
my shanghai or did that I also had that said
that in my childhood book okay and that's

718
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:17,850
fine but at the advanced level it is extremely
detrimental to their practice

719
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:33,540
so China book number five I will start discussing
this we are channel handbook number two

720
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:40,310
okay I will not the bottom line is that you
probably don't know how to ask but the bottom

721
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:45,580
line is I'm not telling you how to fix it
none your business

722
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:52,469
okay because what happens we explain too much
to you like that woman who asked which level

723
01:39:52,469 --> 01:39:57,040
I'm going to be before I'm free that's why
i explained to you so and say master I just

724
01:39:57,040 --> 01:40:03,659
do this it's not a big deal

725
01:40:03,659 --> 01:40:10,250
it's not knowledge it's about can you do it

726
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:15,580
don't say don't tell me I know I know I know
don't tell me I know I know I feel guilty

727
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:24,460
just tell me when I'm gonna be free of it

728
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:31,380
okay next 205 yeah a few more minutes should
we continue just see how detailed that knowledge

729
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:38,489
of john really is you don't know how to navigate
through a lot of these things you see it's

730
01:40:38,489 --> 01:40:45,140
incredible the precision and detail level
that that this Chan teacher can provide us

731
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:52,889
and this is why these are important you may
not know you may not be able to do it but

732
01:40:52,889 --> 01:40:58,260
in the future when you're there I can tell
you ah remember this section that's where

733
01:40:58,260 --> 01:41:09,429
you are and you say ah now I can do it okay
it takes that that's why uh boys and girls

734
01:41:09,429 --> 01:41:15,570
especially people to the spies who stop asking
me which level I'm going to be free at that

735
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:24,010
bro up that okay I told you it really means
nothing it doesn't help you at all that's

736
01:41:24,010 --> 01:41:30,719
why I don't tell you 205 good knowing advisors
one who awakens to the no thought dharma completely

737
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:36,350
penetrates the ten thousand dharmas one who
awakens with no talk dharma sees all Buddhist

738
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:45,139
realms one who awakens through no thought
dharma arrives at the Buddha position

739
01:41:45,139 --> 01:41:54,820
one

740
01:41:54,820 --> 01:42:02,350
okay it's very very good okay uh I i admit
to you that I didn't appreciate this as much

741
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:11,600
when I first explained this section uh three
four years ago four years ago because I uh

742
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:19,290
started with this mind the frame of mind says
i only need to explain it to the extent of

743
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:26,010
my chair I explained and that's good enough
so never the adventure out of what he did

744
01:42:26,010 --> 01:42:32,040
not want to explain I'm telling you that it's
not something that that that he doesn't understand

745
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:38,760
he understands is probably better than I do
most likely better than I do because he decided

746
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:43,290
not to explain it why not because it's his
disciples weren't ready

747
01:42:43,290 --> 01:42:57,989
okay so he says here uh when you understand
this no thought dharma this practice of no

748
01:42:57,989 --> 01:43:04,409
thoughts that we've been trying to explain
to you completely penetrate the ten thousand

749
01:43:04,409 --> 01:43:12,120
dharmas means that what is completely penetrated
ten thousand dharma ten thousand dharma refers

750
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:18,230
to ten thousand things what are the ten thousand
things ten thousand things to the indians

751
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:25,889
to the Chinese is everything they don't have
a number like gazillion like we do nowadays

752
01:43:25,889 --> 01:43:36,930
okay they only have ten thousand and beyond
ten thousand oh this is too much okay so they

753
01:43:36,930 --> 01:43:42,139
completely penetrate the ten thousand dharma
everything what is completely penetrate everything

754
01:43:42,139 --> 01:43:53,730
meaning that you see through everything you're
not attached to anything

755
01:43:53,730 --> 01:44:01,119
okay yeah so uh when you uh what does it mean
awakens in no thought dharma

756
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:16,380
huh

757
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:31,639
foreign

758
01:44:31,639 --> 01:44:46,899
[Music]

759
01:44:46,899 --> 01:44:54,010
by the way it's not depression

760
01:44:54,010 --> 01:44:59,179
depression was this morning this is something
else

761
01:44:59,179 --> 01:45:11,190
but I let him torture her for a while

762
01:45:11,190 --> 01:45:19,619
translation a myth of a master during the
time that I entered the retreat I read um

763
01:45:19,619 --> 01:45:27,760
flour a dormant sutra it is said this a thousand
dharma doesn't have its own self if you understand

764
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:35,080
this then your dharma eyes is inconceivable
meaning if you understand this way it this

765
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:43,639
way your dharma eyes is inconceivable

766
01:45:43,639 --> 01:45:49,489
okay no

767
01:45:49,489 --> 01:45:50,489
stick to this

768
01:45:50,489 --> 01:46:00,260
it has no the reference that doesn't doesn't
apply here what he's talking about is the

769
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:06,699
person whoever awakens the no thought dharma
what does it mean awaken the no thought dharma

770
01:46:06,699 --> 01:46:18,340
meaning that you say ah I can do it that's
what awakens I'm awake it's no longer a dream

771
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:29,040
to me now I'm awake okay you suddenly realize
that whatever you saw before now is was just

772
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:39,440
a dream was not real and when you are able
to uh completely have no thought okay and

773
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:47,470
you're capable of having no thought okay you'll
be able to completely penetrate the ten thousand

774
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:55,420
dharmas you can see through the ten thousand
dharmas you are not attached to anything whatsoever

775
01:46:55,420 --> 01:47:00,150
fame profit

776
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:04,170
nothing whatsoever

777
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:12,830
is that clear that person then sees all Buddha
realms now we're talking about a state of

778
01:47:12,830 --> 01:47:13,830
Buddha

779
01:47:13,830 --> 01:47:23,590
okay this is quite different who we are where
we are

780
01:47:23,590 --> 01:47:30,600
you have this is a special being a special
state of mind that again says remember one

781
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:37,420
who awakens to meaning when you awaken to
it when she awakens it when he awakens it

782
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:38,440
you can all do that

783
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:50,810
the assumption here the suggestion here is
very important do not stop yourself don't

784
01:47:50,810 --> 01:47:59,139
say no it's not for me no it's too far-fetched
no it's too yellow-faced

785
01:47:59,139 --> 01:48:08,050
is that clear this is such an important distinction
don't say that no it's too far-fetched for

786
01:48:08,050 --> 01:48:11,130
me

787
01:48:11,130 --> 01:48:16,590
this is certain dharma certain teaching meaning
that if you don't stop yourself because i

788
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:22,190
can tell you all I want but inside yourself
say yeah it sounds good but I'm not sure i

789
01:48:22,190 --> 01:48:26,099
can do it

790
01:48:26,099 --> 01:48:29,010
i know you traders especially the guy in Korea

791
01:48:29,010 --> 01:48:37,699
he says I don't think I can do it but he said
let me think

792
01:48:37,699 --> 01:48:40,619
okay

793
01:48:40,619 --> 01:48:46,220
got that the reason that you can't do it you
cannot awaken to because you really don't

794
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:51,830
trust yourself you don't have faith in yourself

795
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:56,619
you really don't think deep down you don't
think you can do it like that lady who just

796
01:48:56,619 --> 01:49:07,170
came today and said yeah right I'm the Buddha
i have the Buddha in me yeah right

797
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:11,621
right that's what you go through your head
yeah yeah these people yeah you know they

798
01:49:11,621 --> 01:49:13,540
believe anything these Asian faced

799
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:20,130
doubt is what stops you

800
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:29,820
they don't see the Buddha realms meaning what
the Buddha describes us this is what the six-page

801
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:37,710
chart describes us they cannot see it and
if you can see the uh you're able to to awaken

802
01:49:37,710 --> 01:49:46,000
the no taught dharma you arrive at the Buddha
position you become a Buddha

803
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:52,639
okay he's talking about not enlightenment
you're talking about Buddha now

804
01:49:52,639 --> 01:50:02,099
still have some time shall we get going

805
01:50:02,099 --> 01:50:11,830
why you've been busy too you know the the
the children huh oh wow all right 207 in this

806
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:21,800
way it should be transmitted from generation
generation is silently transmitted and conferred

807
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:22,800
more transfer

808
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:36,000
in 
this way it should be transmitted he says

809
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:42,449
we should help in what way

810
01:50:42,449 --> 01:50:47,020
what way is he referring to it should be transmitted
in what way

811
01:50:47,020 --> 01:51:14,830
um

812
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:19,930
Chinese person you have a problem with translation
or not what should I call you Taiwanese

813
01:51:19,930 --> 01:51:31,010
ranchi chuansho

814
01:51:31,010 --> 01:51:34,639
is a translation

815
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:50,449
correct hmm

816
01:51:50,449 --> 01:52:11,489
is it you agree Chinese uh uh Chinese speaking
people you agree with in this way as a ranch

817
01:52:11,489 --> 01:52:34,619
you try and show it should be transmitted
or not

818
01:52:34,619 --> 01:52:45,300
uh

819
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:55,969
hmm

820
01:52:55,969 --> 01:53:04,929
people

821
01:53:04,929 --> 01:53:05,929
what does it mean

822
01:53:05,929 --> 01:53:07,699
come on

823
01:53:07,699 --> 01:53:29,869
plus

824
01:53:29,869 --> 01:53:52,030
hmm

825
01:53:52,030 --> 01:53:56,310
Chinese specialist I just looked up my Chinese
dictionary

826
01:53:56,310 --> 01:54:07,889
huh anyone see the Chinese are cautious he
said if I say anything I claim a Chinese expert

827
01:54:07,889 --> 01:54:09,260
he's going to jump on me again

828
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:22,000
too bad that it's like early in China what
time is it in China

829
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,480
5 30 in the morning on

830
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:39,900
sunday good lord who gets up that early on
sunday not in China okay so what does it mean

831
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:40,900
okay

832
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:45,050
sorry

833
01:54:45,050 --> 01:54:51,060
i think it means still needs to be transmitted
signature transmitted anyone else

834
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:56,120
huh

835
01:54:56,120 --> 01:55:02,560
okay it should not say in this way because
in this way here is confusing in what way

836
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:15,719
did he say you should tell them so and so
no you should be transmitted

837
01:55:15,719 --> 01:55:19,369
accurately

838
01:55:19,369 --> 01:55:27,390
he's more concerned about making sure that
you teach the next generation properly instead

839
01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:36,000
of doing it this way does it make sense he
says when you teach this do it right convey

840
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:48,280
the message right don't do it this way he
never meant this way this way is ordinary

841
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:57,639
people thinking his concern primarily is convey
it accurately convey it properly does it make

842
01:55:57,639 --> 01:56:03,080
sense have one Chinese person who agrees what
about the Taiwanese

843
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:15,989
okay so I don't know how to translate it it
should be appropriately transmitted properly

844
01:56:15,989 --> 01:56:22,989
transmitted but not in this way in this way
is wrong to me this can is not his intention

845
01:56:22,989 --> 01:56:28,740
at all because when a teacher teaches you
something it's for your own understanding

846
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:33,810
it's up to you to do whatever you want with
it the teacher never expects you to do the

847
01:56:33,810 --> 01:56:43,930
same exact same thing okay as the way he did
that's why I'm very offended when people do

848
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:49,889
all they do is regurgitate you know my teacher
says my teacher says that okay if you're stupid

849
01:56:49,889 --> 01:56:56,080
yeah I agree he said I don't have any wisdom
therefore my teacher says so okay but if that

850
01:56:56,080 --> 01:57:02,670
is the case then you didn't understand the
teacher this would be so disappointing the

851
01:57:02,670 --> 01:57:07,909
sick patriarchs I spend so much you know time
explaining to you the sutra and you simply

852
01:57:07,909 --> 01:57:11,120
repeat what I said seriously

853
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:22,560
why did I come here I could have you know
my mind was sent send a an android a robot

854
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,619
over

855
01:57:26,619 --> 01:57:28,860
okay it should be

856
01:57:28,860 --> 01:57:41,010
probably transmitted how is it fix it from
generation to generation

857
01:57:41,010 --> 01:58:01,310
hey

858
01:58:01,310 --> 01:58:08,989
or you can ask of course goran okay of course
you must transmit it this must be transmitted

859
01:58:08,989 --> 01:58:14,470
but that's that's too familiar I should say
the emphasis here I'm interpreting a little

860
01:58:14,470 --> 01:58:21,620
bit differently I said it should be appropriately
properly transmitted because of his importance

861
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:30,650
not just for uh for us Asians also to the
non-Asians to the Americans to the hispanics

862
01:58:30,650 --> 01:58:38,260
to you know and so forth properly transmitted
for future generation generation generation

863
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:47,119
meaning that it's your responsibility if you
understand it you must transmit it

864
01:58:47,119 --> 01:59:00,500
that's implied it's very heavy responsibility

865
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:07,310
okay so far the first two you agree with that
right uh you would like me to get out okay

866
01:59:07,310 --> 01:59:15,000
refresh so far so good it affects us folks
it's not about them Chinese anymore it's about

867
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:21,909
us future you know this generation and your
children's generation your nieces generation

868
01:59:21,909 --> 01:59:32,480
it affects them we don't do it right okay
we're failing our mission

869
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:39,619
okay silently transmitted and conferred mo

870
01:59:39,619 --> 01:59:43,360
okay

871
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:52,630
silently meaning this transmission here is
mind to mind meaning that a certified the

872
01:59:52,630 --> 02:00:00,000
teacher says yes you understand yes you understand

873
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:08,290
and has nothing to do with anyone else it's
person to person mind to mind that's it it's

874
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:19,500
not meant for you come up here huh would you
turn on the cameras please okay and report

875
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:25,880
the whole world that I confer this to him

876
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:32,480
and we appreciate your support and donations
we planned new maha stupa half a billion dollars

877
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:41,280
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh easy so it's the opportunity
for us to

878
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:50,830
raise awareness of the importance of the dharma
okay because it's useful for you and your

879
02:00:50,830 --> 02:00:56,119
future generation think about your children
you don't get it how about your children okay

880
02:00:56,119 --> 02:01:05,570
not that it's silently transmitted it's very
quiet it's no big deal okay it's it's a certification

881
02:01:05,570 --> 02:01:14,389
and conferred confirmed meaning it's given
the responsibility if you understand that

882
02:01:14,389 --> 02:01:22,600
it's transmitted to you now you have the responsibility
to transmit it to others you don't hide you

883
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:28,829
don't say ah I don't have to do this if it's
given to you it's conferred upon you you have

884
02:01:28,829 --> 02:01:47,170
the responsibility to pass it on properly
silently and convert to next generation

885
02:01:47,170 --> 02:01:52,150
i don't get it we parents when you're a parent
you worry about your children you want to

886
02:01:52,150 --> 02:01:56,230
take care of them you want to educate them
properly yes having a good good education

887
02:01:56,230 --> 02:02:04,890
and and uh good nutrition and so forth okay
make sure that before you let her out you

888
02:02:04,890 --> 02:02:08,730
teach her about

889
02:02:08,730 --> 02:02:11,980
money management

890
02:02:11,980 --> 02:02:16,640
you know that the kids when they go to college
and they get out of the house they have no

891
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:21,989
idea they don't take care of their health
they don't worry about their diet don't worry

892
02:02:21,989 --> 02:02:25,210
about the finances they keep on spending money

893
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:36,100
okay do you see it takes responsibility before
we spring them loose they need to be prepared

894
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:42,949
same thing here for these people this paycheck
it says I'm confirmed give me a silent uh

895
02:02:42,949 --> 02:02:58,650
conferring of this knowledge here this transmission
here now it's your turn to do it as well

896
02:02:58,650 --> 02:02:59,961
you yourself have to live with it

897
02:02:59,961 --> 02:03:08,869
right because your kids fail and blow up the
budget and ruin the healthy because you didn't

898
02:03:08,869 --> 02:03:14,000
prepare them properly

899
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:23,070
anyway um and so uh this is the responsibility
to make sure that we pass on our knowledge

900
02:03:23,070 --> 02:03:33,760
to the future generation that's called love
that's called caring it's not money

901
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:42,690
alone money helps

902
02:03:42,690 --> 02:03:52,750
unless you want to give them to the temple

903
02:03:52,750 --> 02:03:54,920
okay time is up thank you everyone

904
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:57,020

better

906
02:03:59,110 --> 02:04:01,199
uh

907
02:04:01,199 --> 02:04:39,430
because the boy
